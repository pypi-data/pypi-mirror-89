    This release is to tag the Patrole for OpenStack Stein release.
    After this release, Patrole will support below OpenStack Releases:

      * Stein
      * Rocky
      * Queens
      * Pike

    Current development of Patrole is for OpenStack Train development
    cycle. Every Patrole commit is also tested against master during
    the Train cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Patrole as of this tag will work against a Train (or future release)
    cloud.
