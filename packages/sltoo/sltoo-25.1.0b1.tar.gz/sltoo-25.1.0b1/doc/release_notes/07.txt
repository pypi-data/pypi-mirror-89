--------------------

Starting from v7 rmtoo supports git for history and version tracking.
The first small application of this is the requirement count
statistic.

Makefile dependency tracking is now done which the help of rmtoo
itself.  When called with a special command line parameter, it outputs
the depend file which can be read in by a Makefile.

Moved the output parameter handling from the command line to the
config file.  This gives rmtoo the chance to write more than one
output file at a time (parsing in history takes time and this must be
done only once for all output formats).

Fixes bug in requirement parser printing incorrect error messages.
Parser now prints out the requirement id when an error occurs.
Corrects check for uniqueness of node's names (ids).
More tests are added - some minor bugs were found and fixed; resulting 
in 87% test coverage. 

Fixes 'Effort estimation' highlighting problem in Emace mode.

LaTeX 'longtable' is replaced with 'tabular': The longtable
environment run into problems with PDF links.

Tag 'Topic' was added to prepare the upcoming new output engine. 

Man pages were adapted to reflect the current situation.  Man page for
configuration was added.

Documentation enhancements.  Added FAQ document with 'Getting Started'
chapter.

Fixed problem when running the tests from an installed Debian package.


Internal Changes
----------------

Modules loading uses same digraph infrastructure as the
requirement(set).  Code cleanup.  Much better internal error
handling.  Fixed problems with module interface.
