PyNN does not at present support explicit specification of the units of
physical quantities (parameters and initial values). Instead, the following
convention is used:

Physical quantity Units

time              ms
voltage           mV
current           nA
conductance       ÂµS
capacitance       nF
firing rate       /s

Synaptic weights are in microsiemens or nanoamps, depending on whether the post-synaptic mechanism implements a change in conductance or current.
Distances are typically in microns, but any distance scale can be used, provided it is used consistently.
