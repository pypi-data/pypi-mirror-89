    A new policy feature flag called
    ``[policy_feature_flag].changed_nova_policies_ussuri`` has been added to
    Patrole's config to handle Nova policies changed in Ussuri. The policy
    feature flag is applied to tests that use policies changed in Ussuri,
    including the following:

      - os_compute_api:os-services

    Note that not all changed policies are included above because test coverage
    is missing for them.
