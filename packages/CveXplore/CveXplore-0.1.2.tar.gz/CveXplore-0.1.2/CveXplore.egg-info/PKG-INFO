        The CveXplore package aims to provide an object related way to interact with the data collected or hosted by a
        cve-search instance. It provides an ambiguous way to interact either to the cve-search mongodb or to the cve-search API.
        All the data provided by this interaction is converted into objects before being returned. And thus providing a way to
        interact with objects rather then with raw data.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        As stated you will need to have one of two things; in order to fully use this package you need access to:
        
        * A cve-search mongodb instance
        
        OR
        
        * A cve-search API instance
        
        Both of them can be easily created on a physical machine or via a docker instance of cve-search;
        please check `cve-search <https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search>`_ or
        `CVE-Search-Docker <https://github.com/cve-search/CVE-Search-Docker>`_ for further details.
