Description: The **cfdm** Python package is a reference implementation of the `CF
        data model <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/4619/2017>`_, that
        identifies the fundamental elements of the `CF conventions
        <http://cfconventions.org/>`_ and shows how they relate to each other,
        independently of the `netCDF
        <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_ encoding.
        
        The central element defined by the CF data model is the **field
        construct**, which corresponds to a CF-netCDF data variable with all
        of its metadata.
        
        A simple example of reading a field construct from a file and
        inspecting it:
        
            >>> import cfdm
            >>> f = cfdm.read('file.nc')
            >>> f
            [<Field: air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K>]
            >>> print(f[0])
            Field: air_temperature (ncvar%tas)
            ----------------------------------
            Data            : air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K
            Cell methods    : time(12): mean (interval: 1.0 month)
            Dimension coords: time(12) = [0450-11-16 00:00:00, ..., 0451-10-16 12:00:00] noleap
                            : latitude(64) = [-87.8638, ..., 87.8638] degrees_north
                            : longitude(128) = [0.0, ..., 357.1875] degrees_east
                            : height(1) = [2.0] m
        
        The **cfdm** package can
        
        * read field constructs from netCDF and CDL datasets,
        * create new field constructs in memory,
        * write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,
        * read, write, and create coordinates defined by geometry cells,
        * read and write netCDF4 string data-type variables,
        * read, write, and create datasets containing hierarchical groups,
        * inspect field constructs,
        * test whether two field constructs are the same,
        * modify field construct metadata and data,
        * create subspaces of field constructs,
        * incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files, and
        * read, write, and create data that have been compressed by convention
          (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays), whilst presenting a view of the
          data in its uncompressed form.

        Command line utility
        ====================
        
        During installation the `cfdump` command line tool is also installed,
        which generates text descriptions of the field constructs contained
        in a netCDF dataset.
