         Nitime: timeseries analysis for neuroscience data
        ===================================================
        
        Nitime is library of tools and algorithms for the analysis of time-series data
        from neuroscience experiments. It contains a implementation of numerical
        algorithms for time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, a
        set of container objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects that
        expose a high level interface to the numerical machinery and make common
        analysis tasks easy to express with compact and semantically clear code.
