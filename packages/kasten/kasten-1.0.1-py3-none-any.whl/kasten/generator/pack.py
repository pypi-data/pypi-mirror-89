"""Compile Kasten elements into a packed (msgpack) sequence.

KastenPacked sequences are prepared sequences used by Kasten instances and
their generators to apply rules and validation to Kasten.

Note that encryption and signing are not handled by anything in kasten, only
hash authentication is dependending on the generator used.

Packed bytes structure:
0: type: str: 4bytesmax
1: enc-mode: int: 0, 1, 2 (0=plaintext, 1=asymmetic, 2=symmetric).
2. Timestamp: int
encrypted with specified mode:
 3. signer: bytes (max 256bits)
 4. signature: bytes (max 256bits)
 5. app_metadata: arbitrary JSON
\n
data: bytes
