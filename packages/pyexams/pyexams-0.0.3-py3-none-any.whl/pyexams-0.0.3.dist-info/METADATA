# pyexams

Generates variants of exam questions using [texsurgery](https://framagit.org/pang/texsurgery), keeps a question database, exports to pdf and moodle.

Much like [R exams](https://r-exams.org/), but with the following (main) differences:

 1. R-`exams` requires use of R for both creating exam variants and managing R-`exams` itself, while `pyexams` allows any language for exam creation and is called from a command which can be incorporated into your favorite LaTeX editor.
 2. R-`exams` keeps each question in a separate file, then use a simple R script to compose the whole exam, while `pyexams` use a single LaTeX file for the whole exam.
 3. Both R-`exams` and `pyexams` keep a record of past exam questions, but `pyexams` also keeps a database that can be queried in order to find, for instance, all questions with the tag `derivative` that appeared in exams at least two years ago. The question code is also saved in plain text and managed in a `git` repository, which simplifies the management of a shared question bank, whether group-private or totally open.
 4. Last but not least, R-`exams` is a mature and feature rich project, while `pyexams` is a very young project that still has to deliver.

Other important design decisions involved in `pyexams`:

 - The syntax for the questions is exactly that of [auto-multiple-choice](https://www.auto-multiple-choice.net/)
 - We will use [amc2moodle](https://github.com/nennigb/amc2moodle) (or a custom version of it) to generate the moodle question bank.
 - `pyexams` strives to feel as close to LaTeX as possible to its users, which paradoxically is better done through [texsurgery](https://framagit.org/pang/texsurgery) than through a LaTeX package.

## Warning: Proof of concept

This is still a very early version, published to share some points with our colleagues, but that still does not deliver the expected results. Please do not use yet it for your real exams.

## Installation

    python3 -m pip install pyexams

## Usage

  cd examples
  # generates a pdf for the first student in the list (useful for testing)
  pyexams amc2moodle.tex
  # generates one pdf for each first student in the list (runs in parallel)
  pyexams amc2moodle.tex -all
  # generates a moodle question bank
  pyexams amc2moodle.tex -moodle  

## Talk at ENSEMAT II

The motivation behind this project and its design decision was presented (in spanish) at a talk at [ENSEMAT II](https://eventos.upm.es/56532/detail/ensemat-2020.-usos-y-avances-en-la-docencia-de-las-matematicas-en-las-ensenanzas-universitarias.html)
