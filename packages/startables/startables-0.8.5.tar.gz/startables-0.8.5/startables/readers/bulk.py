    """
    Reads all files with supported extensions from supplied path specs and returns a single Bundle
    containing all table blocks read from all files. Any given file's extension determines which
    reader is used to read that file.

    Path specs can be any mix of one or more files, directories, and/or glob expressions.

    Default extensions and corresponding readers are:
        {'xlsx': startables.read_excel,
         'csv' : startables.read_csv}.
    Use the 'readers' argument to overwrite the default extension-reader mapping. This can be used
    to:
        * add more readers for other extensions, e.g.
          readers={**DEFAULT_READERS, **{'docx': startables.import_from_word}};
        * remove the default readers to prevent the default extensions from being read; and/or
        * replace the default readers for the default extensions, e.g.
          readers={**DEFAULT_READERS, **{'csv': functools.partial(read_csv, sep=',')}}.

    Multiple tables with the same name (within or across files) are preserved as such in the output
    bundle.

    Microsoft Office temp files (starting with "~$" or ending with ".tmp") are ignored when bulk
    reading a folder or glob expression.

    :param path_specs: Can be a file, a folder or a glob expression that contains StarTable files
        with supported extensions. Can also be an Iterable of files, folders, and glob expressions.
    :param readers: Dict of form {'ext': reader_func} specifying what function to use to
     read files with extensions beyond the default ext.
     Default: {'xlsx': startables.read_excel, 'csv': startables.read_csv}.
     reader_func must be a callable that takes a single path argument and returns a Bundle.
     File with extensions whose reader is set to None will not be read, e.g. {'xlsx': None, ...}
    :return: Bundle containing the tables read from all files.
