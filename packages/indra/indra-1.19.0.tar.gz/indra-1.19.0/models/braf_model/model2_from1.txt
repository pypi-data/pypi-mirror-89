< EGFR-bound GRB2 binds SOS.
< GRB2-bound SOS binds RAS that is not bound to BRAF V600E.
> EGFR-bound GRB2 binds SOS that is not phosphorylated on a Serine.
> GRB2-bound SOS that is not phosphorylated on Serine binds RAS that is not bound to BRAF V600E.
> SOS not bound to RAS is phosphorylated on Serine by active ERK not bound to DUSP6.
> A phosphatase dephosphorylates SOS on a Serine.
