_pyreview_ is a deploy tool for Heroku Review App using Bitbucket Pipelines.

---

Heroku Review App is a great tool to make ephemeral apps in Heroku. The problem
is that this tool only plays nice with Github. Deploying Review apps from a CI
system is frustrating and hard and still in a very early stage of development.

This tool is an effort to automate the creation of Review Apps using Bitbucket
Pipelines. It should be easy to fork this project and adapted it to another CI
system (or abstract the CI at all).

## *This is a Work in Progress*

This does the job, but don't expect many flexibility at this point. You are
welcome to contribute by opening a issue or a Pull Request. I will pushing the
guidelines to contribute soon.
