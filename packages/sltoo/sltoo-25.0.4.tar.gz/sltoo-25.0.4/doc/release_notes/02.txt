** Removed fixed dependencies
   In v1 there were fixed dependecies between design decisions and
   requirments.  These were too limitating in every days work, so they
   were removed.

** New requirments tag: History

** Added Emacs Mode
   Is located in contrib/req-mode.el
   Functionality: keyword highlighing

** Requirments ending is now .req
   To automatically switch to the requirements editing mode in Emacs,
   a special suffix was needed.

* Internal changes

** Requirment Types handling reorganized

** Added Makefile for internal creation of latex an graph file
