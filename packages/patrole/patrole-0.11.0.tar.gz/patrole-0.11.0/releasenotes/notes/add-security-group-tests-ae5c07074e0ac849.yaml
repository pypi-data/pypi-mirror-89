features:
  - |
    Add security groups and server security groups
    tests to Nova RBAC tests.
fixes:
  - |
    Add microversion check to test_security_groups_rbac
    as tests in this file will fail with a 404 after
    2.36.
  - Rename test_server_security_groups to
    test_list_security_groups to properly reflect the
    test actually being run.
