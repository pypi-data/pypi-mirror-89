# Auto Tracer

Automatic tracing of Python code.

## Purpose

We developed this module for educational purposes. The output of this module is
used to verify code tracings performed by students who are learning to code.

## Usage

To use this program, run:

`python auto_tracer.py FILENAME.py`

Where `FILENAME.py` is the name of the Python file that you wish be checked.

## Disclaimer

This module is in VERY early stage and I don't know how it behaves with larger
pieces of software.
