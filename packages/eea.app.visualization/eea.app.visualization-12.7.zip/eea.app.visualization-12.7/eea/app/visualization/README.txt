=====================
EEA App Visualization
=====================
`EEA App Visualization`_ is the Core API for `EEA Daviz`_. This package was added
in order to be able to use `EEA Google Charts`_ without `EEA Exhibit`_ and
viceversa or any other visualization library as a standalone visualization
or as part of a bundle package (`eea.daviz`_)

This package as standalone is just an API, you have to either install
`eea.daviz`_ bundle, either install one of the available visualization
libraries (`eea.exhibit`_, `eea.googlecharts`_, etc) in order to have a working
Visualization Tool for your files.
