Description: Python Docs Sphinx Theme
        =========================
        
        This is the theme for the Python documentation.
        
        Note that when adopting this theme, you're also borrowing an element of the
        trust and credibility established by the CPython core developers over the
        years. That's fine, and you're welcome to do so for other Python community
        projects if you so choose, but please keep in mind that in doing so you're also
        choosing to accept some of the responsibility for maintaining that collective
        trust.
        
        To use the theme, install it into your docs build environment via ``pip`` 
        (preferably in a virtual environment).
        
        
        Configuration options
        ---------------------
        
        To use this theme, add the following to ``conf.py``:
        
        - ``html_theme = 'python_docs_theme'``
        
        - ``html_sidebars``, defaults taken from http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/config.html#confval-html_sidebars
