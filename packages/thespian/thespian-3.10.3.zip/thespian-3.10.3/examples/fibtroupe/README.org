* Troupe example

This example shows how the use of the Actor Troupe to run multiple
Actors can help to parallelize longer-running actor operations.

The ~fibactor.py~ file contains a simple actor that performs "work" by
computing fibonacci numbers of varying sizes inefficiently.  It also
contains an Actor Troupe specification, which is essentially the same
actor but with the ~@troupe()~ decorator.

When run as a simple application, the ~fibactor.py~ will show timing
outputs from troupe and non-troupe implementations; the source is
commented and designed to be readable and modified for
experimentation.
