Welcome to kalabash-sievefilters's documentation!
================================================

This extension lets users create server-side message filters, using
the `sievelib module <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sievelib>`_ (which
provides Sieve and ManageSieve clients).

Two different modes are available:

* A raw mode: you create filters using the Sieve language directly
  (advanced users)
* An assisted mode: you create filters using an intuitive form
