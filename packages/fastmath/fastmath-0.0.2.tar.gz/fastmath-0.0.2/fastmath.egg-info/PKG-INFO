Description: # FastMath
        
        The best math libary for python
        
        ## Usage
        
        To add numbers do:
        `add(1, 2)`
        
        This is the same as 1 + 2
        
        To subtract do:
        `sub(2, 3)`
        
        This is the same as 2 - 3
        
        To multiply do:
        `mul(2, 2)`
        
        This is the same as 2 * 2
        
        To divide do:
        `div(4, 2)`
        
        This is the same as 4 / 2
        
        To caculate the area of a circle do:
        
        `circle_area(5)`
        
        This is the same as 5^2 * 3.14
        
        To use the quadratic formula do:
        
        `qudratic(6, 17, 12)`
        
        This is the same as (-17 (+ or -) sqrt(17^2 - 4 * 6 * 12)) / 2 * 6
