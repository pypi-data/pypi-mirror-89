# NuRadioMC examples

## ARA effective volume calculation
### 1st step: generate input events
`python E01generate_event_list.py`
this script will create a hdf5 file containing the neutrino vertices/directions/energies etc. in the folder _event_input_
In this example the neutrino energy is set to 1e19eV and 10,000 events are generated, so that the simulation runs relatively fast

### 2nd step: end-to-end simulation
the second step involves the ray tracing, Askaryan signal generation and detector simulation. Execute
`python E03RunARAsimulation.py event_input/1e19_n1e4.hdf5 detectors/ARA/50m_1GHz.json output/ARA/50m_1e19eV.hdf5`
make sure that you created the folder _ouput/ARA_ so that the output file can be written
The simulation takes about 30min on my 3 year old laptop.

### 3rd step: plot results
the script `T05visualize_sim_output.py` produces the standard output/debug plots from the hdf5 output file. Just execute
`python T05visualize_sim_output.py output/ARA/50m_1e19eV.hdf5`
This script will also save the plots to _output/ARA/50m_1e19eV.hdf5/plot/_ for later inspection.
