JupyterLab 2.x toÂ 3.x Extension Migration Guide
===============================================

This is a migration guide for updating extensions that support JupyterLab 2.x to work in JupyterLab 3.x.

Upgrading library versions manually
-----------------------------------

To update the extensions so it is compatible with the 3.0 release, update the compatibility
range of the ``@jupyterlab`` dependencies in the ``package.json``. The diff should be similar to:

.. code:: diff

   index 6f1562f..3fcdf37 100644
   --- a/package.json
   +++ b/package.json
      "dependencies": {
   -    "@jupyterlab/application": "^2.0.0",
   +    "@jupyterlab/application": "^3.0.0",

Upgrading library versions using the upgrade script
---------------------------------------------------

JupyterLab 3.0 provides a script to upgrade an existing extension to use the new extension system and packaging.

First, make sure to update to JupyterLab 3.0 and install ``jupyter-packaging`` and ``cookiecutter``. With ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

   pip install jupyterlab -U
   pip install jupyter-packaging cookiecutter


Or with ``conda``:

.. code:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab=3 jupyter-packaging cookiecutter


Then at the root folder of the extension, run:

.. code:: bash

   python -m jupyterlab.upgrade_extension .

The upgrade script creates the necessary files for packaging the JupyterLab extension as a Python package, such as
``setup.py`` and ``pyproject.toml``.

The upgrade script also updates the dependencies in ``package.json`` to the ``^3.0.0`` packages. Here is an example diff:

   }


On the diff above, we see that additional development scripts are also added, as they are used by the new extension system workflow.

The diff also shows the new ``@jupyterlab/builder`` as a ``devDependency``.
``@jupyterlab/builder`` is a package required to build the extension as a federated extension.
It hides away internal dependencies such as ``webpack``, and produces the assets that can then be distributed as part of a Python package.

Extension developers do not need to interact with ``@jupyterlab/builder`` directly, but instead can use the
``jupyter labextension build`` command. This command is run automatically as part of the ``build`` script
(``jlpm run build``).

Publishing the extension to PyPI and conda-forge
------------------------------------------------

Starting from JupyterLab 3.0, extensions can be distributed as a Python package.

The extension tutorial provides explanations to package the extension so it can be
published on PyPI and conda forge: :ref:`extension_tutorial_publish`.

.. note::

   While publishing to PyPI is the new recommended way for distributing extensions to users,
   it is still useful to continue publishing extensions to ``npm`` as well,
   so other developers can extend them in their own extensions.
