Scripts to determine the relationship between shower energy and maximum distance to a station. This is used
in the code to speed up the calculation as antennas that are too far away can just be skipped.

Json files contain the relevant data points (maximum distance as a function of shower energy)

dist_vs_edge_Greenland_1.5sigma:
	- 1.5 sigma dipole (bicone_v8) at 100m depth in Greenland ice for a noise temperature of 300K and a band of 80-500MHz.
