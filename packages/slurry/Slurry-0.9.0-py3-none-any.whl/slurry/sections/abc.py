            connections for instance, you may want to handle this exception yourself.

        The ``ThreadSection`` pump method is designed to have an api that is as close to the
        async api as possible. The input is a synchronous iterable instead of an async iterable,
        and the output is a synchronous callable, similar to a ``Queue.put`` method.

        Ordinary async sections and synchronous threaded sections can be freely mixed and matched
        in the pipeline. The pipeline will automatically detect the section type, as long as you
        inherit from this abc, and it will take care of launching the pump function in a thread
        and bridge the input and outputs between trio and sync.

            Trio has a limit on how many threads can run simultaneously. See the
