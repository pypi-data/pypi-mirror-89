What is PyMedPhys?
------------------

An open-source Medical Physics python library with a focus on being
a place to share, review, improve, and transparently learn off of each
other's code. It is inspired by the collaborative work of our physics peers
in astronomy and their `Astropy Project`_. PyMedPhys is available on `PyPI`_
and `GitHub`_.

.. _`Astropy Project`: http://www.astropy.org/
.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project/pymedphys/
.. _`GitHub`: https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys


Mailing list
------------

If you would like to dive into the community a great place to get started is
to sign up to `the mailing list`_ and say hi by introducing yourself with
where you're from, and what you hope to achieve with PyMedPhys.

.. _`the mailing list`: https://groups.google.com/g/pymedphys


Beta level of development
-------------------------

PyMedPhys is currently within the ``beta`` stage of its life-cycle. It will
stay in this stage until the version number leaves ``0.x.x`` and enters
``1.x.x``. While PyMedPhys is in ``beta`` stage, **no API is guaranteed to be
stable from one release to the next.** In fact, it is very likely that the
entire API will change multiple times before a ``1.0.0`` release. In practice,
this means that upgrading ``pymedphys`` to a new version will possibly break
any code that was using the old version of pymedphys. We try to be abreast of
this by providing details of any breaking changes from one release to the next
within the `Release Notes`_.

For Python Users
................

- Absolute Beginners Tutorial **[Doesn't yet exist]**

  - Start here if you are new to Python and would like an in-depth instruction on
    how to get started.

- `Quickstart How-To Guide`_

  - Start here if you are fluent in Python and just want a quick instruction on how
    to get started.

- `Tutorials`_

  - A range of lessons that take you through various complete projects with the
    intent to be able to show you what can be achieved with writing PyMedPhys based
    Python software yourself.
  - These are aimed at you if you don't yet know what you can achieve with
    PyMedPhys but you would like to learn.

- `How-To Guides`_

  - Guides and recipes for common problems and tasks. These are aimed for you if
    you already know how to use Python and PyMedPhys and are looking for direction
    on a specific task you are trying to solve.

- `Reference`_

  - Technical reference for the `library`_ (modules, functions and classes),
    as well as the available `command line tools`_. This is where you will find
    listed information for the exposed functionality of PyMedPhys.
  - This is aimed at you if you know exactly the feature you would like to use, you
    just want to see what inputs it requires and what outputs it gives.

- `Background`_

  - Explanation and discussion of key topics and concepts. This is aimed at you if
    you are looking to be able to think about PyMedPhys and its implementations at
    a higher level and understand more about them.
