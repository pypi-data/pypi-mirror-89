Developers' guide

This guide contains information about contributing to PyNN development, and aims
to explain the overall architecture and some of the internal details of the
PyNN codebase.

PyNN is open-source software, with a community-based development model:
contributions from users are welcomed, and the direction that PyNN development
should take in the future is determined by the needs of its users.

There are several ways to contribute to PyNN:

 * reporting bugs, errors and other mistakes in the code or documentation;
 * making suggestions for improvements;
 * fixing bugs and other mistakes;
 * adding or maintaining a simulator backend;
 * major refactoring to improve performance, reduce code complexity, or both.
 * becoming a maintainer

The following sections contain guidelines for each of these.
