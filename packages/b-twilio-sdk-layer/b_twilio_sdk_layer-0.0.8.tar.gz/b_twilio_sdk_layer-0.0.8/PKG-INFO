Description: # B.TwilioSdkLayer
        
        An AWS CDK based lambda layer containing Twilio SDK for python.
        
        ### Description
        
        This library is intended to simplify Twilio SDK dependency management
        in AWS architectures where Twilio logic is being handled with lambda
        functions. Simply include this layer when creating a lambda function
        to enable Twilio functionality.
        
        **NOTE!** In order to use this layer, a `docker` command must be available
        on your machine. It is because the CDK runs a bundling command on a 
        docker container to create the Twilio dependency.
