Description: 
        spyks is a tool for building and simulating simple, dynamical neuron models. It
        places a strong emphasis on efficient modification of parameters, because it's
        primarily intended for use in data assimilation applications where the goal is
        to estimate parameters and unmeasured states from recorded data. It is very much
        a work in progress.
