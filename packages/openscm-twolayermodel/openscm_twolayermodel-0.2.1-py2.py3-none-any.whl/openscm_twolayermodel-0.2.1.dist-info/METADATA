Openscm Two Layer Model
=======================

.. sec-begin-index

OpenSCM two layer model contains implementations of the two layer radiative forcing driven models by `Held et al. <https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2009JCLI3466.1>`_, `Geoffroy et al. <https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00195.1>`_ and `Bloch-Johnson et al. <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL064240>`_

OpenSCM Two Layer Model was designed to provide a clean, modularised, extensible interface for one of the most commonly used simple climate models.
It was used in `Phase 1 of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project <https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-5175-2020>`_ as a point of comparison for the other participating models.

The `FaIR model <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR>`_ implements a mathematically equivalent model (under certain assumptions) but does not provide as clear a conversion between the two-layer model and the two-timescale response as is provided here.
We hope that this implementation could interface with other simple climate models like FaIR to allow simpler exploration of the combined behaviour of interacting climate components with minimal coupling headaches.

As implemented here, the "OpenSCM Two Layer Model" interface is target at researchers and as an education tool.
Users from other fields are of course encouraged to use it if they find it helpful.
