History
-------

Thespian was developed at GoDaddy as part of the support for GoDaddy's
dedicate and virtual server product line.  At one point, Thespian was
helping to manage 10,000 physical servers via a combination of
on-server and remote actors.

The primary Thespian author (Kevin Quick) is no longer working at
GoDaddy, but through GoDaddy's willingness to open-source the Thespian
code and transfer the rights to this author, this repository is still
being maintained and developed.  With heartfelt thanks to the Vertigo
team at GoDaddy, this Python Actor model has been developed and
refined to provide a highly functional library for general use.
