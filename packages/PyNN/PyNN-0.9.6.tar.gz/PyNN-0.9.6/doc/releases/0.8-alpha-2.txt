PyNN 0.8 alpha 2 release notes
==============================

May 24th 2013

Welcome to the second alpha release of PyNN 0.8!

For full information about what's new in PyNN 0.8, see the :doc:`0.8-alpha-1`.

This second alpha is mostly just a bug-fix release, although we have added a new
class, :class:`CloneConnector` (thanks to Tom Close), which takes the connection
matrix from an existing :class:`Projection` and uses it to create a new :class:`Projection`,
with the option of changing the weights, delays, receptor type, etc.

The other big change for developers is that we have switched from Subversion to
Git. PyNN development now takes place at https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN/
