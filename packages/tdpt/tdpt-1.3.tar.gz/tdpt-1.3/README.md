## FAQ

### `Transmission` already supports running script upon finishing download
Yes, that is true.  However the script that `transmission` will run will
be executed in the same thread.  That means any long running process
would freeze it for that amount of time which is highly undesirable.

### `tdpt` picks up new items so slow
Currently it fetches new items every 20 seconds, because this operation
can be quite expensive.  I might add option to specify this interval
based on your preferences.

### I am downloading 20 items and `tdpt` updates them very rarely
`Telegram` puts limit of how often bot can make request to one channel.
Currently the limit is 20 updates per minute.  `tdpt` makes time
adjustment based on number of torrents that it tracks to avoid hitting
limits.
