The presentation was splitted in two parts and completely
restructured.

rmtoo-art-xml-ganttproject2, rmtoo-art-xml1 and
rmtoo-template-project.

Fixed analytics heuristics: words were only counted once.

Internal Changes
----------------

Moved the status chapter of the requirements document for rmtoo to the
end of the document.

Moved all created documents to the artifacts directory.

Fixed error in blackbox test 11 which referenced data of blackbox test
9. 

Fixed typo in method name: continnum -> continuum.

Rejected Changes
----------------

At one point it looked that the create continuum from file was called
twice.  It was now verified that this is not true: it is always called
no more than once.
