usage: 'm3u_maker [-h] [--show-discarded] [sources [sources ...]]

    Finds music files by extension (flac, ogg, oga, wav, mp3,
    aiff, aif, loss, m4a, aac, alac, mogg, opus. webm, mp4, wma, mpc)
    inside folders and it's subdirectories, makes a m3u file
    without metadata


positional arguments:
  sources               
                        Source directories that contains the music
                        (subdirectories are included).
                        We suggest to use an absolute path for better
                        compatibility with players.
                        If you want to use relative paths remember that them
                        are relative to the location of the output m3u file.
                        Defaults to the directory where the script is called
                        from (`pwd`).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --show-discarded, -d  shows discarded files (txt, images, playlists, etc) on stderr
