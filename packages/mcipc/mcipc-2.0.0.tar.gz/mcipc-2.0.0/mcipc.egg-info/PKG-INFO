Description: # mcipc
        A Minecraft inter-process communication API implementing the [RCON](http://wiki.vg/RCON) and [Query](http://wiki.vg/Query) protocols.
        
        ## Requirements
        `mcipc` requires Python 3.8 or higher.  
        It also depends on [rcon](https://github.com/conqp/rcon) which has been split from this project.  
        If you install `mcicp` via `pip`, it will automatically be installed as a dependency.
        
        ## Documentation
        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mcipc/badge/?version=latest)](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)  
        Documentation is available on [readthedocs](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
        
        ## Quick start
        
        Install mcipc from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-mcipc/) or via:
        
            pip install mcipc
        
        ### Query protocol
        The `Query` protcol is used to query a Minecraft server for server information.  
        The Minecraft query protocol has two query modes: *basic stats* and *full stats*.
        
        ```python
        from mcipc.query import Client
        
        with Client('127.0.0.1', 25565) as client:
            basic_stats = client.basic_stats    # Get basic stats.
            full_stats = client.full_stats      # Get full stats.
        
        print(basic_stats)
        print(full_stats)
        ```
        
        ### RCON protocol
        The `RCON` protocol is used to remotely control a Minecraft server, i.e. execute
        commands on a Minecraft server and receive the respective results.
        
        ```python
        from mcipc.rcon import Client
        
        with Client('127.0.0.1', 5000) as client:
            client.login('mysecretpassword')    # Perform initial login.
            seed = client.seed                  # Get the server's seed.
            players = client.players            # Get the server's players info.
            mansion = client.locate('Mansion')  # Get the next mansion's location.
        
        print(seed)
        print(players)
        print(mansion)
        ```
