Description: # antelope
        Standard Interface and reference framework for LCA
        
        The `antelope` package is an interface specification for accessing LCA data resources, as described in [JIE submitted].  It should be subclassed by implementations that wish to expose data using this uniform interface.  A reference implementation, including a stand-alone LCA computing tool, exists...
