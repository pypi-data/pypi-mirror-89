    The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) is a prototype web
    service with the goal of:
    - Providing a curated source of continuously updated natural event metadata
    - Providing a service that links those natural events to thematically-related
        web service-enabled image sources (e.g., via WMS, WMTS, etc.).

    Development of EONET began in 2015 and has been supported by NASAâ€™s Earth
    Observatory and Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project.
