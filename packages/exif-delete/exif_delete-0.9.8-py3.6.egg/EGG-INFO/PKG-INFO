Description: # exif_delete
        
        All the photos you share online contain metadata. This metadata can include:
        
        * the location the photo was taken
        * the time the photo was taken
        * detailed information about your camera / phone
        
        Facebook (and most other online advertisers) make money by tracking and selling your personal information. But *you* should be in control of what information you share with the world.
        
        Enter the `exif_delete` tool.
        
        This is a simple Python script that I use to strip all of the metadata from my photos before I share them online.  It is lightweight and easy-to-use.  If you are like me, you take a lot of photos, and this tool will help protect your privacy.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        This script will work with Python v3.4 to v3.7 and only requires one third-party library: `PIL`.
        
        You can install this tool using PyPI to grab the code and install it online by doing:
        
            pip install exif_delete
        
        Or you can install from this repo locally:
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        This is a simple commandline tool.  Just pass the name of the image file(s) you want to strip to the script, and it will do the rest:
        
            python exif_delete.py /path/to/my/image.jpg
        
            python exif_delete.py image1.jpg image2.png image3.gif
        
            python exif_delete.py /path/to/*/my/images/*.jpg
        
        By default, the script will create a new image file with `"_safe"` appended to the file name.  For instance, this:
        
            /full/path/to/image1234.jpg
        
        will become:
        
            /full/path/to/image1234_safe.jpg
        
        However, if you want to just over-write the original image file by stripping all the EXIF data from it, you can add the `--replace` flag:
        
            python exif_delete.py --replace /path/to/my/image.jpg
