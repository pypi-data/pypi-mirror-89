Description: # Run any blocking command with systray icon
        
        This is mainly useful for background processes.
        It gives you an indication that it's running and allows
        you to send a `SIGINT` signal by clicking on the `Quit` menu item.
        
        ```
        # Install withtray
        pip install --user withtray
        
        # Copy your icon to ~/.local/share/icons and run
        withtray 'polly server' --name polly --icon polly
        ```
