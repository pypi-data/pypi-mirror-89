        ## Work Experience
        ### Deploy Team at Stripe (Apr 2019 - Present)
        *San Francisco, CA (and partially remote)*
        
        * Lead the project for implementing automated deployment health evaluation for our deployment system.
        * Contributed to creating blue/green deployments to improve the company's services' reliability and fault tolerance story.
        * Designed improvments to the deployment web frontend (internal developer-facing) to be more clear and user-friendly.
        * Holds the (unofficial) team record for most robot tickets cleared in a week (a major contributor to the team's debt and toil).
        
        ### Release Engineering at Yelp (Nov 2017 - Apr 2019)
        *San Francisco, CA*
        
        * Worked on an internal frontend service that tracks and displays tech debt and developer prductivity.
        * Designed and implemented API for determining responsibility and ownership of code, databases, and other resources.
        * Improved Git management tools and code review infrastructure to be more resilient to catastrophic failures.
        
        ### Trading and Data at Old Mission Capital (Aug 2016 - May 2017)
        *Chicago, IL*
        
        * Improved data pipeline and research infrastructure reliability and usability.
        * Added parallelism to data ingestion and created automated sanity checking to reduce overhead of analysis.
        * Developed a Python package for quickly scripting models and risk calculation on live market data.
        
        ### Trading Intern at Old Mission Capital (Jun 2015 - Aug 2015)

        ## Projects
        ### [GPU Compression](https://github.com/yiwensong/lzss)
        
        * Parallelized implementation of LZSS compression for the GPU with CUDA.
        * The goal of the project was to test feasibility of using message compression in HPC applications.
        * Result: your network needs to be *really* bad for this to be worth anything.
        
        ### [ImgCompress](https://github.com/yiwensong/imgcompress)
        
        * ImgCompress is a hackathon project aimed at becoming the future of compression.
        * Uploads binaries to Imgur as PNGs and stores the 7 character Imgur URL.
        * Compression ratio is over 700 000 and implementation is less than 200 lines of python.
        * Better than the CUDA stuff I made.
        
        ### [Poker AI](https://github.com/yiwensong/huplo)
        
        * Heads Up Pot-Limit Omaha (HUPLO) AI that uses Monte Carlo search trees and bad machine learning.
        * ðŸ’© at poker.
        * Passable at Tic-Tac-Toe.
        
        ### [Yet Another Personal Site | DefDontHire.Me](https://github.com/yiwensong/yiwensong.github.io)
        
        * Technology has advanced to a point where you can create a beautiful website without knowing any web.
        * Literally anyone can download a Bootstrap template and write some BS and call it a personal site.
        * [Exhibit A](http://yiwensong.com)
        
        ### [yiwen.date](https://github.com/yiwensong/yiwen.date)
        
        * Another personal site, but maybe a little more personal.
        * Frontend written in React, backend written with Flask.
