About U.S. Government Works

U.S. government creative works are usually produced by government employees as part of their official duties. These works include writings, images, videos, and computer code. A government work is generally not subject to copyright in the U.S. Unless the work falls under an exception, anyone may, without restriction under U.S. copyright laws:

+ Reproduce the work in print or digital form 
+ Create derivative works 
+ Perform the work publicly 
+ Display the work 
+ Distribute copies or digitally transfer the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending 

Copyright Exceptions for U.S. Government Works

Most U.S. government creative works such as writing or images are copyright-free. But not everything is. So before you use a U.S. government work, check to make sure it does not fall under one of these exceptions:

+ Other people may have rights in the work itself or in how the work
is used, such as publicity or privacy rights. Privacy and publicity
rights protect the interests of the person or people who may be the
subject of the work. Learn more about copyright, privacy, and
publicity rights from the Library of Congress.

+ You cannot use government trademarks or government agencies' logos
without permission. For example, you cannot use an agency logo or
trademark on your social media page.

+ You cannot use a government work in a way that implies endorsement
by a government agency, official, or employee. For example, you can't
use a photo of a government official wearing your product in an ad.

+ Works prepared for the government by independent contractors may be
protected by copyright. The copyrights may be owned by the independent
contractor or by the U.S. government.

+ Not everything that appears on a government website is a government
work. Content on a government website may be protected intellectual
property used with the rights holder's permission. This content can
include:

Text 
Trademarks 
Logos 
Images 

To ensure that you donâ€™t use protected intellectual property, check
with the agency or program that manages the website.

+ The U.S. government work designation does not apply to works of
state and local governments. Works of state and local governments may
be protected by copyright.

+ Copyright laws differ internationally. U.S. copyright laws may not
protect U.S. government works outside the country. But the work may be
protected under the copyright laws of other jurisdictions when used in
these jurisdictions. The U.S. government may assert copyright outside
of the United States for U.S. government works.
