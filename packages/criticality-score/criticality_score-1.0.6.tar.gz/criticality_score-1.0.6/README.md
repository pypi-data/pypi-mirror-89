# Open Source Project Criticality Score (Beta)

This project is maintained by members of the
[Securing Critical Projects WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-critical-projects).

## Goals
1. Generate a **criticality score** for every open source project.

1. Create a list of critical projects that the open source community depends on.

1. Use this data to proactively improve the security posture of these critical projects.

## Criticality Score

A project's criticality score defines the influence and importance of a project.
It is a number between
**0 (least-critical)** and **1 (most-critical)**. It is based on the following
[algorithm](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/blob/main/Quantifying_criticality_algorithm.pdf)
by [Rob Pike](https://github.com/robpike):

We use the following parameters to derive the criticality score for an
open source project:

| Parameter (S<sub>i</sub>)  | Weight (&alpha;<sub>i</sub>) | Max threshold (T<sub>i</sub>) | Description | Reasoning |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| created_since | 1 | 120 | Time since the project was created (in months) | Older project has higher chance of being widely used or being dependent upon. |
| updated_since  | -1 | 120 | Time since the project was last updated (in months) | Unmaintained projects with no recent commits have higher chance of being less relied upon. |
| **contributor_count** | **2** | 5000 | Count of project contributors (with commits) | Different contributors involvement indicates project's importance. |
| org_count | 1 | 10 | Count of distinct organizations that contributors belong to | Indicates cross-organization dependency. |
| commit_frequency | 1 | 1000 | Average number of commits per week in the last year | Higher code churn has slight indication of project's importance. Also, higher susceptibility to vulnerabilities.
| recent_releases_count | 0.5 | 26 | Number of releases in the last year | Frequent releases indicates user dependency. Lower weight since this is not always used. |
| closed_issues_count | 0.5 | 5000 | Number of issues closed in the last 90 days | Indicates high contributor involvement and focus on closing user issues. Lower weight since it is dependent on project contributors. |
| updated_issues_count | 0.5 | 5000 | Number of issues updated in the last 90 days | Indicates high contributor involvement. Lower weight since it is dependent on project contributors. |
| comment_frequency | 1 | 15 | Average number of comments per issue in the last 90 days | Indicates high user activity and dependence. |
| **dependents_count** | **2** | 500000 | Number of project mentions in the commit messages | Indicates repository use, usually in version rolls. This parameter works across all languages, including C/C++ that don't have package dependency graphs (though hack-ish). Plan to add package dependency trees in the near future. |

**NOTE**:

- We are looking for community ideas to improve upon these parameters.
- There will always be exceptions to the individual reasoning rules.

## Usage

The program only requires one argument to run, the name of the repo:

```shell
$ pip3 install criticality-score

$ criticality_score --repo github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
name: kubernetes
url: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
language: Go
created_since: 79
updated_since: 0
contributor_count: 3664
org_count: 5
commit_frequency: 102.7
recent_releases_count: 76
closed_issues_count: 2906
updated_issues_count: 5136
comment_frequency: 5.7
dependents_count: 407254
criticality_score: 0.9862
```

You can add your own parameters to the criticality score calculation. For
example, you can add internal project usage data to re-adjust the project's
criticality score for your prioritization needs. This can be done by adding
the `--params <param1_value>:<param1_weight>:<param1_max_threshold> ...`
argument on the command line.

### Authentication

Before running criticality score, you need to:

- For GitHub repos, you need to
[create a GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/about-apps#personal-access-tokens)
and set it in environment variable `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`.
This helps to avoid the GitHub's
[api rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)
with unauthenticated requests.

```shell
# For posix platforms, e.g. linux, mac:
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>

# For windows:
set GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>
```

- For GitLab repos, you need to
[create a GitLab access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
and set it in environment variable `GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN`.
This helps to avoid the GitLab's api limitations for unauthenticated users.

```shell
# For posix platforms, e.g. linux, mac:
export GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>

# For windows:
set GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>
```

### Formatting Results

There are three formats currently: `default`, `json`, and `csv`. Others may be added in the future.

These may be specified with the `--format` flag.

## Public Data

If you're only interested in seeing a list of critical projects with their
criticality score, we publish them in `csv` format.

This data is available on Google Cloud Storage and can be downloaded via the
[`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)
command-line tool or the web browser
[here](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/ossf-criticality-score/index.html).

**NOTE**: Currently, these lists are derived from **projects hosted on GitHub ONLY**.
We do plan to expand them in near future to account for projects hosted on other
source control systems.

```shell
$ gsutil ls gs://ossf-criticality-score/*.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/c_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/cplusplus_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/go_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/java_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/js_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/php_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/python_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/rust_top_200.csv
gs://ossf-criticality-score/shell_top_200.csv
```

This data is generated using this
[generator script](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/blob/main/criticality_score/generate.py).
For example, to generate a list of top 200 C language projects, run:

```shell
$ python3 -u -m criticality_score.generate \
    --language c --count 200 --sample-size 5000
```
