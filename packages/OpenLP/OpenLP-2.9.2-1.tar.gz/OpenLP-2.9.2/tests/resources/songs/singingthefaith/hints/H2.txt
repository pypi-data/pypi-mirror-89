
1   Amazing Grace! how sweet the sound!
    That saved a wretch like me!
    I once was lost, but now am found;
    Was blind, but now I see.

2   'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    And grace my fears relieved.
    How precious did that grace appear,
    The hour I first believed.

3   The Lord has promised good to me,
    His Word my hope secures.
    He will my shield and portion be
    As long as life endures.

4   Thro' many dangers, toils and snares
    I have already come.
    'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
    And grace will lead me home.

5   When we've been there ten thousand years,
    Bright shining as the sun,
    We've no less days to sing God's praise,
    Than when we first begun.


John Newton (d. 1807)
