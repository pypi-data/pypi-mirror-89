Description: # Digital Signal Processing Toolbox
        This code started as a C++ program to perform trapezoidal filtering to a digitized signal from 
        [XIA LLC's Pixie-16 hardware](https://www.xia.com/dgf_pixie-16.html). The original sample code came
        from a VB program using [IGOR](https://www.wavemetrics.com/) as its base. It fairly well approximates 
        the filter calculations that happen on a Pixie-16 module. These algorithms are mostly focused around 
        XIA's hardware and function, but can be applied to **any** digitized signal. 
        
        ## Module Descriptions
        ## filtering
        ### trapezoidal_filters.py
        XIA LLC uses [trapezoidal filtering](https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774600) to calculate 
        trigger positions and energies. The functions in this script approximate the Pixie-16 on-board 
        calculations. We have functions to calculate
        * trigger positions,
        * signal baseline,
        * signal energy,
        * and trigger and energy responses.
         
        We've made no attempt to convert bins to time. Users can do this trivially if they know the sampling
        frequency of their signal. 
        
        ## sample_data
        ### sample_traces.py
        This script contains sample signals that users can use to explore the performance of the code. See 
        the in code documentation for more information about the signals. 
        
        ## Installation
        As of right now the programs don't have any special dependencies. Just download and run.
