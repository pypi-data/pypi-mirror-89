Description: ## SSLAP
        
        This library provides implementations for solvers for **S**uper **S**parse **L**inear **A**ssignment **P**roblems.
        
        An assignment problem is one where a one-to-one assignment has to be made between two sets, where each assignment has an associated cost.
        
        In super sparse assignment problems, typically less than 1% of all feasible assignments are allowed.
        
        This library provides two algorithms:
        - Auction Algorithm - An algorithm well suited for super sparse problems. It is one in which *people* in one set 'bid' for *objects* in the other set, driving up their prices in order to find an optimal assignment. 
        - Sparse Hungarian - A simple implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm, leveraged for sparse matrices
        
        Both of these problems are implemented in Cython, with a pure Python implementation of the Hungarian algorithm also provided.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```pip install -e .```

        ## Notes
        
        - A matrix passed into from_matrix requires positive values only, and -1 indicates invalid values.
