Pipettor Overview

pipettor - robust, easy to use Python package for running Unix process pipelines

Features
--------

* Creating process pipelines in Python is either complex (e.g. ``subprocess``),
  or not robust (e.g. ``os.system()``).  This package aims to address these shortcomings.
* Command pipelines are simply specified as a sequence of commands, with each
  command represented as a sequence of arguments.
* Failure of any process in the pipeline results in an exception, with ``stderr``
  included in the exception.
* Pipeline ``stdin/stdout/stderr`` can be passed through from parent process,
  redirected to a file, or read/written by the parent process.
* Asynchronous reading and writing to and from the pipeline maybe done without risk of
  deadlock.
* Pipeline can run asynchronously or block until completion.
* Popen-style File-like objects for reading or writing a pipeline.
* Documentation: https://pipettor.readthedocs.org.





History
=======

0.5.0 (2020-12-25)

* Switch to using subprocess as a base rather interface directly
  interface with Unix system calls.  This lets subprocess deal with
  various issues dealing with the Python interpreter environment.  

0.4.0 (2018-04-21)
------------------
* Allow passing through universial newline mode for PY2.
* Fix bug with not using specified log level.
