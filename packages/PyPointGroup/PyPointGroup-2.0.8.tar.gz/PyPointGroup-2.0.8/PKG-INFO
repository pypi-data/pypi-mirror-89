Description: # PointGroup Software
        
        The **PointGroup** software allows you to visualize point symmetry groups (*OpenGL*).
        
        ## Main features of the program
        1. Visualization of a point symmetry group selected from the list.
        2. Visualization of the point symmetry group given by the group generators.
        3. Group generators can be specified in the form of matrices, as well as selected from the list.
