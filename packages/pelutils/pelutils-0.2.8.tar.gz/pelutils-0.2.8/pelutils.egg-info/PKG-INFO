Description: # pelutils
        Utility functions that we commonly use including flexible parser, logger and time taker.
        
        ## Parser
        A combination of parsing CLI and config file arguments which allows for a powerful, easy-to-use workflow.
        Useful for parametric methods such as machine learning.
        
        ## Logger
        Easy to use logger which fits common needs.
        
        ## TickTock
        Simple time taker inspired by Matlab Tic, Toc, which also has profiling tooling
        
        ## DataStorage
        Mutation of dataclass that saves/loads its fields from disk
        
        
        # 0.2.8
        
            - Add code to execute code with specific environment variables
        
        # 0.2.7
        
            - Fix error where the full stacktrace was not printed by log.throw
            - set_seeds now checks if torch is available. This means torch seeds are still set without needing it as a dependency
        
        # 0.2.6
        
            - Make Unverbose class private and update documentation
            - Update formatting when using .input
        
        # 0.2.5
        
            - Add input method to logger
        
        # 0.2.4
        
            - Better logging of errors
        
        # 0.2.1 - BREAKING CHANGES
        
            - Removed torch as dependency
        
        # 0.2.0 - BREAKING CHANGES
        
            - Logger is now a global variable. Logging should happen by importing the log variable and calling .configure to set it up. To reset the logger, .clean can be called.
            - It is still possible to just import Logger and use it in the traditional way, though .configure should be called first.
            - Changed timestamp function to give a cleaner output.
            - get_commit now returns None if gitpython is not installed.
        
        # 0.1.2
        
            - Update documentation for logger and ticktock.
            - Fix bug where seperator was not an argument to Logger.__call__.
        
        # 0.1.0
        
            - Include DataStorage.
            - Logger can throw errors and handle seperators.
            - TickTock includes time handling and units.
            - Minor parser path changes.
        
        # 0.0.1
        
            - Logger, Parser, TickTock added from previous projects.
