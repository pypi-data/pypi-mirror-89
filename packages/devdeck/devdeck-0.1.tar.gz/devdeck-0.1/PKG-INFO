        * Slack
        * Timer

        ## Custom Controls
        Can find support for what you want? Implement your own `DeckControl` or `DeckController`Â·
        
        * `DeckControl`
          
          A `DeckControl` is an individual button that can be placed on a deck.
          
        * `DeckController`
        
          A `DeckController` is fronted by a button, pressing the button will take you to a deck screen tailored for the
          given functionality.
          
          For example: Slack is implemented as a DeckController. Pressing the slack button will then present you with buttons
          for specific statuses.
