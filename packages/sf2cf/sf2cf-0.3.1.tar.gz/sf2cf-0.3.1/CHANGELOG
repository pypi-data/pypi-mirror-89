Based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.3.1] - 2020-12-29
### Fixed
- The xdg module is no longer a required dependency. It was an issue on systems
  where both pyxdg and xdg were installed, since they use the same namespace.

## [0.3] - 2020-12-28
### Fixed
- Use the right name for PyPI

## [0.2] - 2020-12-28
### Added
- sf2cf now looks for a configuration file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME if no config
  file was specified using "-c"

### Changed
- The logger is no longer passed to the plugins as an argument. It is instead
  retrieved using logging.getLogger
- All plugins now inherit from sf2cf.sf2cf.FeedFixer

### Fixed
- Fix the error message displayed when unexpected errors occur
