        If you are using markdown to create tutorials for your users, these markdown files will often be a series of shell commands that a user will copy and paste into their shell of choice, along with detailed text description of what each command is doing.
        
        If you are regularly releasing software and having to manually verify your tutorials by copy pasting commands into a terminal every time you create a release, this is the package for you.
        
        The mechanical-markdown package is a python library and corresponding shell script that allow you to run annotated markdown tutorials in an automated fashion. It will execute your markdown tutorials and verify the ouput according to expected stdout/stderr that you can embed directly into your markdown tutorials. 
        
        # Installing 
        
        This package requires a working python3 environment. You can install it using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install mechanical-markdown
        ```
        
        This will install the python module, and create the ```mm.py``` CLI script.
