upgrade:
  - |
    The ``admin_only`` kwarg has been removed from ``rbac_rule_validation``
    decorator because it is no longer used by any tests. Besides that,
    it should not be used because Patrole is dedicated to RBAC testing and
    an admin-only check is not RBAC because it does not use ``oslo.policy``
    library.
