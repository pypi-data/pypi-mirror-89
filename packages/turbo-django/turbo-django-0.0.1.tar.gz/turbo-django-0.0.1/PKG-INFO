Description: # Turbo for Django
        
        This repository aims to help you integrate [Hotwire Turbo](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/) with Django. Inspiration might be taken from [@hotwired/turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails).
        
        We are still in the early stage of this project so don't expect anything remotely production grade for a while.
        
        Discussions about a Django/Hotwire integration are happening on the [Hotwire forum](https://discuss.hotwire.dev/t/django-backend-support-for-hotwire/1570).
        
        ## Experiments
        
        As we are several to experiment on the integration, I suggest we all dump our code in a sub-directory of `experiments/` so we can all benefit from the ideas of others. Improvements and utilities can then be generalized out into the `turbo` package at the top-level.
        
        ## Turbo
        The `turbo` directory contains the package with helpers, templatetags and utilities for integrating Turbo tightly into Django. Currently, it contains a `Broadcastable` mixin and a Django Channels websocket consumer to allow for realtime updates with Turbo Streams.
