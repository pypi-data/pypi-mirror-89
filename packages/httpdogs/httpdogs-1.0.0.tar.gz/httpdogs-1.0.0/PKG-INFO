        Getting URLs to your favourite HTTP dogs made easy!
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        Installing `httpdogs` is easy, just run `pip install httpdogs`!
        
        ### Usage
        
        I've developed `httpdogs` to make using HTTP dogs simple and fun.
        
        Currently, you can get your dogs using one of two functions - `dog_by_name` and `dog_by_code`
        
        `dog_by_name(name: str)` takes in a sole parameter - `name`, which is the status code name to get a dog for.
        Upon finding a dog matching the name, it returns an `HTTPDog` object. Here's an example -
        
        ```py
        from httpdogs import dog_by_name
        
        my_dog = dog_by_name("Success")
        
        print(f"My dog has a code of {my_dog.code} and means {my_dog.name}! The URL is {my_dog.url}")
        # Prints - 
        # My dog has a code of 200 and means Success! The URL is https://http.dog/200
        ```
        
        `dog_by_code(code: int)` is extremely similar to `dog_by_name`, just using a status code value.
        Upon finding a dog matching the code, it returns an `HTTPDog` object. Here's an example -
        
        ```py
        from httpdogs import dog_by_code
        
        my_dog = dog_by_code(404)
        
        print(f"My dog has a code of {my_dog.code} and means {my_dog.name} :( The URL is {my_dog.url}")
        # Prints - 
        # My dog has a code of 404 and means Not Found :( The URL is https://http.dog/404
        ```
        
        ##### The HTTPDog object also has an `image` attribute
        
        You can use this attribute to get the image bytes associated with the dog.
        You can then save it or view it, like in the example below -
        
        ```py
        from httpdogs import dog_by_code
        from PIL import Image
        from io import BytesIO
        
        my_dog = dog_by_code(302)
        
        dog_image = Image.open(BytesIO(my_dog.image))
        dog_image.show()
        
        # Output below -
        ```
        
        <img src="https://httpstatusdogs.com/img/302.jpg" alt="dog" width="300"/>
