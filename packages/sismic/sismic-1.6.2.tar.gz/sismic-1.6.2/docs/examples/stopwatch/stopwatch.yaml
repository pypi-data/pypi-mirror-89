statechart:
  name: Stopwatch
  description: |
    A simple stopwatch which support "start", "stop", "split", and "reset".
    These features are triggered respectively using "start", "stop", "split", and "reset".

    The stopwatch sends an "refresh" event each time the display is updated.
    The value to display is attached to the event under the key "time".

    The statechart is composed of two parallel regions:
     - A "timer" region which increments "elapsed_time" if timer is running
     - A "display" region that refreshes the display according to the actual time/lap time feature

  preamble: elapsed_time = 0
  root state:
    name: active
    parallel states:
      - name: timer
        initial: stopped
        transitions:
          - event: reset
            action: elapsed_time = 0
        states:
          - name: running
            transitions:
              - event: stop
                target: stopped
              - guard: after(1)
                target: running
                action: elapsed_time += 1
          - name: stopped
            transitions:
              - event: start
                target: running
      - name: display
        initial: actual time
        states:
          - name: actual time
            transitions:
              - guard: after(0.2)
                target: actual time

                target: lap time
          - name: lap time
            transitions:
              - event: split
                target: actual time
