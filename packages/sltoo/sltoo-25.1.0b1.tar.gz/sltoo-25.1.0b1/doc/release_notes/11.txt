--------------------

Moved directory specification from command line to the
Config.reqs_dir.  This change makes all rmtoo calls (especially in 
Makefiles) incompatible with the new version.  Adapted man page.

Added range specification for history: now any tag or git version id
can be used to define the start and the end of the processes files.  A
special constant 'FILES' allows even to specifies the local (which
might have changes compared to the last checked in version).

Added analytics mode: 
o Limits the number of incoming and outgoing links.
o Checks for good and bad words (en_GB and de_DE - both incomplete).
o Requirement based topic coherence (based on links)
o Topic coherence (based on links)
Add requirements for the analytics.
Based on the results a major redesign on the rmtoo requirements was
done.
Analytics mode is currently in alpha state.

Removed bug in graph2 output which under certain conditions makes dot
to render one node more than once.

Output (especially of topics) is sorted now by the id / name.  This
was neccessary because when unsorted results are not comparable for
black box tests.

Enhanced many man-pages.

Internal Changes
----------------

Completely rewrote of the interface to a version control system
o modularized the access: this makes it possible to easily add other
  version control systems.  The first reference implementation is for
  git.
o git-python is currently changing dramatically.  There were API
  changes from 0.1x to 0.2 and there are also some from 0.2 to
  0.3.  Because it is much work (especially testing different
  versions) it was decided to include git-python and the depending
  libraries into the rmtoo package.  When the interface (API) is
  fixed, they will removed.

Started to add blackbox tests. This increases the coverage rate from
56% to about 83%.  Added gnatt project output checks to blackbox
tests.
