User visible changes
--------------------

Added support for Test Cases.

Fixed latex2 output: there was a bug that the references were printed
many times when there were more than one reference to another
requirement.

Fixed error reporting: there was an error that problems during parsing 
the requirements / topics / constraints directories were not reported
to the user at all.  Instead a python stack trace was printed.  This
was fixed: now the user sees exactly the problems - if there were
some. 

Fixed long path names in graph2 output: Since v22 it is possible to
use subdirectories with requirements.  This results in long names.
These long names are now split up into some lines - with the '/' is
the indicator where to split.

Fixed priority list output: there was a bug that only the requirements
were used for the prios list which are in the last topic worked on.
This is fixed now: all requirements appear (again) in the prios list.
