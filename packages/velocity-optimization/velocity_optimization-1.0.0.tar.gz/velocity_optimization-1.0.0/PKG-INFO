Description: # Velocity optimization
        Optimizes (Maximizes) the velocity profile for a vehicle in real-time respecting physical constraints (e.g., power,
        force, combined acceleration, ...). Takes into account a variable friction potential between road and tires. Max.
        power input can be space-variable (for, e.g., energy strategy purposes).
