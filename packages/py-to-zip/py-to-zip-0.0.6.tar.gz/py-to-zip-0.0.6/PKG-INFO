Description: # py-to-zip
        
        
        py-to-zip is a Python library for distributing Python files. It creates a 
        zip file and a command file from your python code. The result is a zip file 
        that includes the source python files and a file that can be 
        double-clicked in order to run the main python file. The receiving computer 
        should have Python installed and in PATH, but it is not necessary for the receiver 
        to open a python IDE or a command line window.  
        
        py-to-zip runs in Python 3+ and only in Windows. The receiving computer can 
        have all Python versions if your source code supports them.
        
        ## Instructions
        You need to make a settings.ini file like this:
        
        
        ```ini
        [settings]
        main_file=main.py
        # The main file that would be run with the cmd file
        name=name of project
        # You can leave empty, default value is the name of your main file without extension
        glob_pattern=*.py,data/*.png,data/**/*.txt
        # The glob patterns for all the files to add the zip, separated by commas. 
        # Use ** only if using python 3.5 and higher. make sure that it includes your 
        # main file as well. 
        glob_recursive=1 
        # Optional. Set the recursive variable for the glob function,
        # this is only for python 3.5+. If python version is lower, ignores this value.
        cmd_file=command.bat
        # The name of command file,(like run.cmd or play.bat)
        # By default it will be <main_file>.cmd
        python_exe=py
        # The python command that is to be run on receiving computer (py,python,python3,...)
        ```
        **Important:** The main file must be found by glob using the pattern glob_pattern.
        
        To create zip from ini using command line:
        ```
        czip {your ini file}
        # or
        CZip.bat {your ini file}
        # for example:
        czip settings.ini
        ```
        And the py-to-zip creates the zip that includes source and command file 
        automatically in the current folder.
        
        ### Access from python
        To access the py-to-zip from a python file:
        ```python
        from py_to_zip.py_to_zip import by_config
        
        # create ini parameters in python code
        
        by_config(
            dict(main_file="py_to_zip.py", 
                 name="py-to-zip", 
                 glob_pattern="*.py,data\\**\\*.txt",
                 glob_recursive=True, 
                 cmd_file="czip.bat", 
                 python_exe="py",
                 )
        )
        ```
        And the py-to-zip creates the zip that includes source and command file 
        automatically in the current folder, without additional command line commands.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install with pip - type in terminal:
        ```
        (python -m) pip install py_to_zip
        ```
        ## Additional options
        Additional options when calling from Python file:
        ```python
        from py_to_zip.py_to_zip import Zip
        z= Zip(
                 main_file = "py_to_zip.py",  
                 name = "py-to-zip", 
                 glob_pattern = "*.py,data\\**\\*.txt",
                 glob_recursive = True,  
                 cmd_file = "czip.bat",  
                 python_exe = "py",
                 quiet = True or False,
                # if set to False,py-to-zip will not print anything.
                # this can be used also in INI file
        )
        
        #to do the same as before you can use the command:
        z.create_zip()
        #but you can also acsess
        z._find_names() #to find names of file with glob
        z._create_cmd() #to create the cmd script
        ### or alternatively
        from py_to_zip.py_to_zip import _parse_cmd_argev 
        _parse_cmd_argev(["file.ini"])#exactly likce czip {your ini file}
        ```
