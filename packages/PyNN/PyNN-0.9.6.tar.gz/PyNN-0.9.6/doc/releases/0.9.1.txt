PyNN 0.9.1 release notes
========================

May 4th 2017

Welcome to PyNN 0.9.1!


Stochastic synapses
-------------------

This release adds three new standard synapse models, available for the NEST and NEURON simulators. They are:

* :class:`SimpleStochasticSynapse` - each spike is transmitted with a probability `p`.
* :class:`StochasticTsodyksMarkramSynapse` - synapse exhibiting facilitation and depression, implemented using the model
    of Tsodyks, Markram et al., in its stochastic version.
* :class:`MultiQuantalSynapse` - synapse exhibiting facilitation and depression with multiple quantal release sites.

There are some new example scripts which demonstrate use of the synapse models - see :doc:`../examples/stochastic_synapses`
and :doc:`../examples/stochastic_deterministic_comparison`.

Note that the new models require building a NEST extension;
this is done automatically during installation (when running :command:`pip install` or :command:`setup.py install`).
