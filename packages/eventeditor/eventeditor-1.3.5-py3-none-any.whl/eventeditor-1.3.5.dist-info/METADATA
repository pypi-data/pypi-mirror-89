## EventEditor for Breath of the Wild

### Setup

Install Python 3.6+ (**64 bit version**) and PyQt5, then run `pip install eventeditor`.

### Auto completion

In order to enable auto completion for actors, actions and queries, add:

```ini
[paths]
rom_root=/path/to/game_rom
```

to EventEditor's configuration file, where `/path/to/game_rom` is a path such that
`/path/to/game_rom/Pack/Bootup.pack/Actor/AIDef/AIDef_Game.product.sbyml` exists.
An easy, recommended way to get the required file structure without extracting every archive
is to use [botwfstools](https://github.com/leoetlino/botwfstools).

The configuration file is stored:

* On Linux or macOS: at `~/.config/eventeditor/eventeditor.ini`
* On Windows: at `%APPDATA%/eventeditor/eventeditor.ini`

### Known issues

* Unlinking events while in fork/join will break graph generation most of the time. So using that option is not recommended when fork/join events are involved.

### What needs to be done

* Timeline files (reverse engineering)

* Collect event info from EventInfo and have a metadata file for each event flow, so that:
    * EventInfo can be automatically regenerated
    * All copies of an event flow can be automatically updated

* Node order shuffling to get less crossings. This used to be a dagre.js feature but it got removed...
