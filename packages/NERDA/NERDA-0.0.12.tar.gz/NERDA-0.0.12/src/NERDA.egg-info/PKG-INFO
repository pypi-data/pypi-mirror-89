        Fine-tuning of transformer-based models for Named Entity Recognition (=NER) tasks.
        
        ## Installation guide
        ```
        pip install NERDA
        ```
        
        ## NER tasks
        Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks are all about identifying and 
        extracting names of named entitites from natural language texts. 
        
        Read more about NER on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition).
        
        ## '`NERDA`'?
        '`NERDA`' originally stands for *'Named Entity Recognition for DAnish'*. However, this
        is somewhat misleading, since the functionality is no longer limited to Danish. 
        On the contrary it generalizes to all other languages, i.e. NERDA supports 
        fine-tuning of transformer-based models for NER tasks for any arbitrary 
        language.
