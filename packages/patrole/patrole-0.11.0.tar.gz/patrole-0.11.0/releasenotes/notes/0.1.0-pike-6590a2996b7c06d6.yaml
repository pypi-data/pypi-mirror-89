    Patrole currently supports RBAC testing for Cinder, Glance, Nova, Neutron
    and Keystone.

    The release under current development as of this tag is Pike,
    meaning that every Patrole commit is also tested against master branch
    during the Pike cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that
    using Patrole as of this tag will work against Pike (or future
    releases) cloud. In addition, backward compatibility with previous
    releases is not guaranteed.
