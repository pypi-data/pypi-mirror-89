 ![OVL Logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45563197/76566629-d4301300-64b5-11ea-9868-40ecde73dcaa.png)

Python Module for Computer Vision Object Tracking and Detection mainly for the FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition Program

Ovl support complex yet modular computer vision pipelines that are easy to create and modify.

Easy to create and setup for beginners and flexible for pros

## Documentation

There are multiple code examples [here](https://github.com/1937Elysium/Ovl-Python/tree/master/code%20examples)

Documentation is available [here](https://ovl.readthedocs.io/) 



### Dependencies:

The following python module dependencies are needed:

 - OpenCV 
  
 - numpy
  
The following python modules are optional for certain features:


 - NetworkTables (pyNetworkTables) for `NetworkTableConnection` (installed automatically)
 
 - Requests (requests) for `HTTPConnection`
 
 - PySerial (pyserial) for `SerialConnection`

OVL is officially supported for python 3.5+ only!

Installation:

Using `pip`:
<br>
  `python -m pip install ovl`

## Usage:

The library uses simple yet highly customizable syntax to create
 a vision pipeline using the `Vision` object


A pipeline that detects a yellow circle:
```
import ovl

# filter contours that are larger than 200 pixels
# and are approximately a circle and then sort by size

contour_filters = [ovl.area_filter(min_area=200),
                   ovl.circle_filter(min_area_ratio=0.7),
                   ovl.area_sort()]

threshold = ovl.YELLOW_HSV  # Define the wanted color to detect 

yellow_circle = ovl.Vision(threshold=threshold,
                           target_filters=target_filters,
                           camera=0,  # open the first connected camera
                           image_filters=[ovl.gaussian_blur()])

while True:
    image = yellow_circle.get_filtered_image()
    contours, filtered_image = yellow_circle.detect(image)
    directions = yellow_circle.get_directions(contours, filtered_image)

    print(directions)  # prints out the (x, y) coordinates of the largest target


```
