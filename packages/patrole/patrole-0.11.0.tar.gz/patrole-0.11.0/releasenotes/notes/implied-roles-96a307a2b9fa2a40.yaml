    Supporting the role inference rules API gives Patrole an ability of testing
    role chains, when one role implies the second which can also imply the
    third:

      ``admin`` implies ``member`` implies ``reader``

    Now in a case of testing against an ``admin`` role (``[patole]
    rbac_test_roles`` = ``admin``) the ``rbac_rule_validation.action`` calls
    the ``rbac_utils.get_all_needed_roles`` function to extend the roles
    and validates a policy rule against the full list of possible roles:

      ["admin", "member", "reader"]

    Here is few examples:
        ["admin"] >> ["admin", "member", "reader"]
        ["member"] >> ["member", "reader"]
        ["reader"] >> ["reader"]
        ["custom_role"] >> ["custom_role"]
        ["custom_role", "member"] >> ["custom_role", "member", "reader"]
