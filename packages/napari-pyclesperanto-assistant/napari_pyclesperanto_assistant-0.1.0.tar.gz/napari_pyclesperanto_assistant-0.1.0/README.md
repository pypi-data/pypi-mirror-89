## Installation

Download and install [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari/releases/). 
After that, windows user should follow the instructions in the section below.

... more details coming soon ...

### Installation on windows
On windows some additional steps are necessary. Download a pre-compiled wheel of [pyopencl](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/) e.g. from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopencl). 
It is recommended to install `pyopencl-...+cl21-cp38-cp38-win_amd64` - the `cl12` and `cp38` are important when choosing the right download. They stand for OpenCL 1.2 and Python 3.8.

Enter your username and the correct `pyopencl-...` filename in the following line and execute it from the command line:
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\napari\python\python.exe -m pip install pyopencl-2020.2.2+cl12-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
```

In case napari doesn't start up  ([see also](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/2022)), enter your username in the following line and execute it from the command line:
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\napari\python\python.exe -m pip install numpy==1.19.3
```

## For developers
