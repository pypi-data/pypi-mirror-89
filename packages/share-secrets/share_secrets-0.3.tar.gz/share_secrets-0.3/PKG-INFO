Description: A simple secret sharing tool made in python3 as a student Project , It uses Repeated Encryption using Modular addition
          of one time generated random key with size equal to data fed as input and data itself , so that even for same data fed as input in each
          attempt , secret codes splitted by the program will be different. Even if one of the generated secret backup codes is lost then the secret data
          will be lost forever...
