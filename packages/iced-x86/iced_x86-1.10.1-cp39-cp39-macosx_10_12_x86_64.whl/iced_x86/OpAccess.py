The memory operand doesn't refer to memory (eg. ``LEA`` instruction) or it's an instruction that doesn't read the data to a register or doesn't write to the memory location, it just prefetches/invalidates it, eg. ``INVLPG``, ``PREFETCHNTA``, ``VGATHERPF0DPS``, etc. Some of those instructions still check if the code can access the memory location.
