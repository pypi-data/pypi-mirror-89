==========
Governance
==========

PyNN is a community-developed project, we welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in
the project. The project maintainers are the members of the `PyNN Developers team`_.
All contributors agree to abide by the Code of Conduct, see below.

Contributions
=============

All contributions must be by pull request, with the exception of quick bug fixes affecting fewer
than ten lines of code.
Normally, pull requests may be approved by any maintainer, although anyone is welcome to join in
the discussion.
In case of disagreement with a decision, we will try to reach a consensus between maintainers,
taking account of any input from the wider community.
If consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be based on a majority vote among the maintainers,
with the caveats that (i) only one vote per institution is allowed (i.e. in the case where several
maintainers belong to the same institution they will have to agree among themselves how to vote)
and (ii) a quorum of three maintainers must be achieved.

Maintainers
===========

Any contributor who has had at least three pull requests accepted may be nominated as a maintainer.
Nominations must be approved by at least two existing maintainers, with no dissenting maintainer.
In case of disagreement, decisions on accepting new maintainers will be based on a majority vote
as above.

Contributor Code of Conduct
===========================

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers
pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without
  explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of
unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is
representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community
include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting
the project team at pynn-maintainers@protonmail.com. The project team will review and investigate
all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The
project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
