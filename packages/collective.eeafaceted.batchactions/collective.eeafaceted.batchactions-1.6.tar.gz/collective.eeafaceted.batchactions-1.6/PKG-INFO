        ==================================
        
        This package gives the possibility to define batch actions on elements displayed in a eea.facetednavigation dashboard
        
        * `Source code @ GitHub <https://github.com/IMIO/collective.eeafaceted.batchactions>`_
        * `Releases @ PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.eeafaceted.batchactions>`_
        * `Continuous Integration @ Travis-CI <http://travis-ci.org/IMIO/collective.eeafaceted.batchactions>`_
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        This will display BrowserViews registered for `collective.eeafaceted.batchactions.interfaces.IBatchActionsMarker` or
        an interface subclassing it at the bottom of a eea.facetednavigation dashboard.
        
        Using a `collective.eeafaceted.z3ctable` `CheckBoxColumn`, you will be able to select elements to tigger the batch action on.
        
        Batch actions are overridable from a faceted navigation container to another if necessary.
        
        
        Installation

        =========
        
        
        1.6 (2020-12-21)
        ----------------
        
        - After action applied, do not reload the entire page,
          just reload the current faceted results.
          [gbastien]
        - Use `CheckBoxFieldWidget` instead `SelectFieldWidget` to manage labels to
          (un)select in `LabelsBatchActionForm` to avoid manipulation with
          `CTRL+click` for selection. Adapted and rationalized translations.
          [gbastien]
        - Add a `collective.fingerpointing` entry when applying action to know
          which action was applied on how much elements.
          [gbastien]
        
        1.5 (2020-04-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Make sure elements are treated in received `uids` order. Need to rely on

          [gbastien]

        1.0 (2018-06-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved js variables to `collective.eeafaceted.z3ctable`.
          [gbastien]
        
        0.7 (2018-06-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Render batch action form in overlay by default, but otherwise with form 'overlay' attribute set to False.
          [sgeulette]

        - Added condition on apply button.
          [sgeulette]
        - Added _update_widgets method
          [sgeulette]
        
        0.5 (2018-01-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Some changes to made it working with a simple z3c.table.
          [sgeulette]
        
        0.4.1 (2017-12-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed english po file.
          [gbastien]
        
        0.4 (2017-12-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Added `collective_eeafaceted_batchactions_js_variables.js` that allows to
          translate the `no_selected_items` message.
          [gbastien]
        
        0.3 (2017-11-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Renamed `BatchActionForm` to `BaseBatchActionForm` to show that it is the base
          form to inherit from to build new batch action.  Make it inherit from
          `Form` instead `EditForm`.
          [gbastien]
        - Refactored the way form is updated and applied : two methods are there to be
          overrided : `_update` that is called in the `update` process and `_apply` that
          is called by `handleApply`.  This way it is easy to build an new action
          without having to think about basic default behavior.
          [gbastien]
        - In the `TransitionBatchActionForm`, sort selectable transitions alphabetically.
          [gbastien]
        
        0.2 (2017-11-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Use `getMultiAdapter` instead `restrictedTraverse` when getting the form
          in the viewlet to speed up things.
          [gbastien]
        - Added attribute `button_with_icon` to a batch action, if set to True,
          a particular CSS class is added to the button so it can be skinned
          with an icon easily.
          [gbastien]
        - Register a `batch_actions.css` resource for basic styling.
          [gbastien]
        
        0.1 (2017-11-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
