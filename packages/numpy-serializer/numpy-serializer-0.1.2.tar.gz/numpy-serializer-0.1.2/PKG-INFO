Description: # numpy-serializer
        
        ## Motivation
        
        I couldn't find a nice high-level package that is fast enough to serialize and deserialize numpy arrays while preserving the type
        and shape informations.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install numpy-serializer
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        
        ```python3
        import numpy_serializer as ns
        import numpy as np
        
        a = np.random.normal(size=(50,120,150))
        b = ns.to_bytes(a)
        c = ns.from_bytes(b)
        assert np.array_equal(a,c)
        ```
