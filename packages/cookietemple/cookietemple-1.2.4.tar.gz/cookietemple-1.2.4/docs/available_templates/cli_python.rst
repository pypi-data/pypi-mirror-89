cli-python
----------

Purpose
^^^^^^^^

cli-python is a `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ based template designed for command line applications,
but it may also be easily used as standard Python package without any command line interface. It is an improved version of `cookiecutter-pypackage <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage>`_.

Design
^^^^^^^^

| The Python package is based on a standard `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ structure including a :code:`setup.py`, :code:`setup.cfg`, :code:`MANIFEST.in`,
  :code:`requirements.txt` and :code:`requirements_dev.txt` file.

Included frameworks/libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for code packaging
2. `click <https://click.palletsprojects.com/>`_, `argparse <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html>`_ or no command line interface
3. `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ or `unittest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_ as testing frameworks
4. Preconfigured `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to run pytest matrices with different Python environments
5. Preconfigured `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
6. Eleven Github workflows:

  1. ``build_docs.yml``, which builds the readthedocs documentation.
  2. ``build_package.yml``, which builds the cli-python package.
  3. ``run_flake8_linting.yml``, which runs `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ linting.
  4. ``run_tox_testsuite.yml``, which runs the tox testing suite.
  5. ``publish_package.yml``, which publishes the package to PyPi. Note that it only runs on Github release and requires PyPi secrets to be set up.
  6. ``run_codecov``, apply codecov to your project/PRs in your project and create automatically a report with the details at `codecov.io <https://codecov.io>`_
  7. ``run_bandit``, run `bandit <https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit>`_ to discover security issues in your python code
  8. ``pr_to_master_from_patch_release_only``: Please read :ref:`pr_master_workflow_docs`.
  9. ``check_no_SNAPSHOT_master.yml``: Please read :ref:`pr_master_workflow_docs`
  10. ``run_cookietemple_lint.yml``, which runs ``cookietemple lint`` on the project.
  11. ``sync_project.yml``, which syncs the project to the most recent cookietemple template version


We highly recommend to use click (if commandline interface is required) together with pytest.

Usage
^^^^^^^^

The generated cli-python project can be installed using::

    make install

or alternatively::

    python setup.py install

Your package is then installed globally (or in your virtual environment) on your machine and can be called from your favorite shell::

    <<your_project_name>>

Other make targets include::

    make clean

which removes all build files::

    make dist

which builds source and wheel packages, which can then be used for a PyPi release using

    make release

All possible Makefile commands can be viewed using::

    make help

FAQ
^^^^^^

Do I need a command line interface?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

No you do not need a command line interface. cli-python can also be used as a Python package.

Does cli-python offer `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ support?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

No, but we would like to add it in the future. Contributions are welcome!
