Description: # craynn
        
        Yet Another toolkit for Neural Network slightly flavoured by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays. 
        
        ## Philosophy
        
        `CrayNN` is highly influenced by [Lasange](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne):
        
            Simplicity: Be easy to use, easy to understand and easy to extend, to facilitate use in research
            Transparency: Do not hide Theano behind abstractions, directly process and return Theano expressions or Python / numpy data types
            Modularity: Allow all parts (layers, regularizers, optimizers, ...) to be used independently of Lasagne
            Pragmatism: Make common use cases easy, do not overrate uncommon cases
            Restraint: Do not obstruct users with features they decide not to use
            Focus: "Do one thing and do it well"
        
        Just replace `theano` with `tensorflow`.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### via PyPi
        
        `pip install craynn`
        
        ### via git
        
        `craynn` can be installed directly from `gitlab.com`:
        `pip install git+https://gitlab.com/craynn/craynn.git`
        however, as repository updates frequently, it is recommend to clone the repository
        and install the package in development mode:
        ```
        git clone git@gitlab.com:craynn/craynn.git
        cd craynn/
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        **NB**: don't forget to install proper version of `craygraph` in a similar manner:
        ```
        git clone git@gitlab.com:craynn/craygraph.git
        cd craygraph/
        pip install -e .
        ``` 
        
        ## Usage
        
        Check out jupyter notebooks in `examples/`. 
        
        ## Quick guide
        
        `craynn` is designed for rapidly defining networks of all sorts:
        ```python
        from craynn import network, conv, max_pool
        
        net = network((None, 1, 28, 28))(
          conv(16), conv(24), max_pool(),
          conv(16), conv(24), max_pool(),
          conv(16), conv(24), max_pool(),
        )
        ```
