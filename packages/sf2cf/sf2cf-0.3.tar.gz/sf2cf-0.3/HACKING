# sf2cf development

## Sending patches
Patches may be sent by email, using "git format-patch" and "git send-email". The
"tox -epep8" command must be successful.

## Adding a plugin
One may write their own plugin and maintain it outside of sf2cf. This requires a
little setuptools magic in setup.py:

```python
setup(...
    entry_points = {
        'sf2cf.feed': [
            'plugin_name = path.to.module:PluginFeed'
        ]
...)```

The plugin itself can be written using the following template:

```python
from sf2cf import sf2cf


LOG = logging.getLogger('sf2cf')  # A logger is provided


class PluginFeed(sf2cf.FeedFixer):
    name = 'plugin_name'
    version = '0.1'
    description = ... # A short description of the plugin
    sample_conf = ... #Â A configuration example

    def __init__(self, conf_section):
        # conf_section is the configuration section provided by the user.
        ...

    def run(self):
        # Do your thing here!
        ...
```
