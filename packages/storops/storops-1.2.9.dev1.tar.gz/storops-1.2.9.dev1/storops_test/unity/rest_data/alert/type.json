    "description": "Information about alerts generated by the storage system.  <br/>  <br/>  Alerts are usually events that require attention from the system  administrator. Most, although not all, alerts indicate that there is a problem  with the storage system. For example, you might receive an alert telling you that  a drive has faulted, or that the storage system is running out of space.  <br/>  <br/>  For information about configuring alerts, see the Help topics for the  alertConfig and  AlertConfigSNMPTarget resource types.  <br/>  <br/>  <b>Some of the user-visible attributes in this object should be changed to  eng-only.</b>  @engdocs  Holds a single AlertEvent info like Component id, Severity, Resolution ID,  Description ID. As of now CLI does not use the Alert Indication. But going  forward CLI can query the Alerts in the System instead of the Alert History.    This object shows up in the GUI through BAM indication. The IndicationManager  native provider processes any CIM_AlertIndication and converts them to  BAM_Indication. We need to create an entirely new EMC_UIS_AlertEvent class in  the new UIS OSLS provider - UIS_AlertServices which will send create  indications to IndicationManager, which in turn will listen to  CIM_CreateIndication instead of CIM_AlertIndication. External API can list the  EMC_UIS_AlertEvent instances to get the list of Alerts in the system and can  listen for CIM_InstCreation for EMC_UIS_AlertEvent for new Alerts generated. In  KH we are planning to change native provider to query EMC_UIS_AlertEvents  instead of EMC_AlertHistoryEntry objects to generate the list of Alerts in the  system.",
