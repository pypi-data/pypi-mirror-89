    Returns the direction the detect objects (contours) are compared to the center

    and 1 the most right compared to the center and 0 meaning perfectly centered

    xy_normalized_directions returns x and y center directions,

    For example:
    If the center of the targets are the center of the image (width / 2, height / 2)
    the returned values are 0 and 0 meaning the camera is centered on the target
