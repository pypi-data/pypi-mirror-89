        A python3.6+ module for physical optics based modeling and processing of data from commerical and open source instrumentation.  Prysm is the fastest numerical diffraction code in the world, more than a factor of 3 faster than its nearest competitor on CPU and more than a factor of 1000 on GPU.  It enables modeling and scientific inquiry not possible with other tools while offering a simple and powerful API that reads like English.
        
        ## Installation
        
        prysm is on pypi:
        ```
        pip install prysm
        ```
        
        prysm requires only [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/).
        
        ### Optional Dependencies
        
        Prysm uses numpy for array operations.  To use an nVidia GPU, you must have [cupy](https://cupy.chainer.org/) installed.  Plotting uses [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  Images are read and written with [imageio](https://imageio.github.io/).  Some MTF utilities utilize [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).  Reading of Zygo datx files requires [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/).
        
        ## Features
        
        Prysm features robust tools for modeling and propagation of wavefronts to image planes and MTF.  It also features object synthesis routines and a flexible convolution system in support of image simulation.  Finally, it contains rich features for analysis of interferometric data.
        
        For a complete list of features, see [the docs](https://prysm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
        
        ## Examples
        
        Several [examples](https://prysm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/index.html) are provided in the documentation.
        
        ## User's Guide
        
        A [guide](https://prysm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/index.html) for using the library is provided in the documentation.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        If you find an issue with prysm, please open an [issue](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/pulls).  Prysm has some usage of f-strings, so any code contributed is only expected to work on python 3.6+, and is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/blob/master/LICENSE.md).  The library is
        most in need of contributions in the form of tests and documentation.
