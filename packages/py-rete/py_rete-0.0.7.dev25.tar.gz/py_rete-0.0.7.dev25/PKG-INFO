        ## Introduction
        
        The py_rete project aims to implement a Rete engine in native python. This
        system is built using one the description of the Rete algorithms provided by
        [Doorenbos (1995)][doorenbos]. It also makes heavy use of ideas from the
        [Experta project][experta] (although no code is used from this project as it
        utilizes an LGPL license).
        
        The purpose of this system is to support basic expert / production system AI
        capabilities in a way that is easy to integrate with other Python based AI/ML
        systems.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This package is installable via pip with the following command:
        `pip install -U py_rete`.
        
        It can also be installed directly from GitHub with the following command:
        `pip install -U git+https://github.com/cmaclell/py_rete@master`
        
        ## The Basics
        
        The two high-level structures to support reasoning with py_rete are **facts**
        and **skills**. 
        
        ### Facts
        
        Facts represent the basic units of knowledge that the skills match over.
        Here are a few examples of facts and how they work.
        
        1. *Facts* are a subclass of dict, so you can treat them similar to dictionaries.
        
        ```python
        >>> f = Fact(a=1, b=2)
        >>> f['a']
        1
        ```
        
        2. Similar to dictionaries, *Facts* do not maintain an internal order of items.
        
        ```python
        >>> Fact(a=1, b=2)
        Fact(b=2, a=1)
        ```
        
        3. *Facts* extend dictionarieis, so they also support values without keys.
        
        ```python
        >>> f = Fact('a', 'b', 'c')
        >>> f[0]
        'a'
        ```
        
        4. *Facts* can support mixed positional and named arguments, but positional
           must come before named and named arguments do not get positional references.
        
        ```python
        >>> f = Fact('a', 'b', c=3, d=4)
        >>> f[0]
        'a'
        >>> f['c']
        3
        ```
        
        ### Skills
        
        Similar to Experta's rules, *Skills* are functions that are decorated with
        conditions that govern when they execute and bind the arguments necessary for
        their execution.
        
        *Skills* have two components:
        * Conditions, which are essentially facts that can pattern matching variables.
        * A Function, which is executed for each rule match, with the arguments to the
          function being passed the bindings from pattern matching variables.
        
        Here is an example of a simple *Skills* that binds with all *Facts* that
        have the color red and prints 'I found something red':
        
        ```python
        @Skill(Fact(color='red'))
        def alert_something_red():
            print("I found something red")
        ```
        
        Skills also support logical operators to express more complex conditions.
        
        ```python
        @Skill(AND(OR(Fact(color='red'),
                      Fact(color='blue')),
        	   NOT(Fact(color='green'))))
        def alert_something_complex():
            print("I found something red or blue without any green present")
        ```
        
        Bitwise logical operators can be used as shorthand to make composing complex conditions easier.
        ```python
        @Skill((Fact(color='red') | Fact(color='blue')) & ~Fact(color='green'))
        def alert_something_complex():
            print("I found something red or blue without any green present")
        ```
        
        In addition to matching simple facts, pattern matching variables can be used to
        match wildcards, ensure variables are consistent across conditions, and to bind
        variables for functions.
        ```python
        @Skill(Fact(firstname='Chris', lastname=V('lastname')) &
               Fact(first='John', lastname=V('lastname')))
        def found_relatives(lastname):
            print("I found a pair of relatives with the lastname: {}".format(lastname))
        ```
        
        It is also possible to employ functional tests (lambdas or other functions) in
        conditions. These tests operate over bound variables, so it is important for
        positive facts that bind with these variables to be listed in the skill before
        the tests that use them.
        ```python
        @Skill(Fact(value=V('a')) &
               Fact(value=V('b')) &
               TEST(lambda a, b: a > b) &
               Fact(value=V('c')) &
               TEST(lambda b, c: b > c))
        def three_values(a, b, c):
            print("{} is greater than {} is greater than {}".format(a, b, c))
        ```
        
        It is also possible to bind *facts* to variables as well.
        ```python
        @Skill(V('name_fact') << Fact(name=V('name')))
        def found_name(name_fact):
            print("I found a name fact {}".format(name_fact)
        ```
        
        Finally, skills also support nested matching using the double underscore. Imagine that the following facts are in the working memory:
        ```python
        Fact(name="scissors", against={"scissors": 0, "rock": -1, "paper": 1})
        Fact(name="paper", against={"scissors": -1, "rock": 1, "paper": 0})
        Fact(name="rock", against={"scissors": 1, "rock": 0, "paper": -1})
        ```
        
        Given, these facts, we might have a skill like the following:
        ```python
        @Skill(Fact(name=V('name'), against__scissors=1, against__paper=-1))
        def what_wins_to_scissors_and_losses_to_paper(name):
            print(name)
        ```
        
        ### Working Memory
        
        To engage in reasoning *facts* and *skills* are loaded into a **WorkingMemory**, which facilitates the matching and application of skills to facts.
        
        Here is how you create a working memory:
        
        ```python
        wm = WorkingMemory()
        ```
        
        Once a memory has been created, then facts can be added to it.
        ```python
        f1 = Fact(light_color="red")
        wm.add_fact(f1)
        ```
        
        Note, facts added to the working memory cannot contain any variables or they will trigger an exception. Additionally, once a fact has been added to working memory it is assigned a unique internal identifier.
        
        This makes it possible to update the fact.
        ```python
        f1['light_color'] = "green"
        wm.update_fact(f1)
        ```
        
        It also make it possible to remove the fact.
        ```python
        wm.remove_fact(f1)
        ```
        
        When updating a fact, note that it is not updated in the working memory until
        the `update_fact` method is called on it. An update essentially equates to
        removing and re-adding the fact.
        
        Skills can also be added to the working memory. When they are added, then the
        the `wm` variable is added to the scope of the function. This `wm` variable
        points to the working memory the skill has been added to, and can be used to
        update the working memory.
        ```python
        >>> f1 = Fact(light_color="red")
        >>> 
        >>> @Skill(V('fact') << Fact(light_color="red"))
        >>> def make_green(fact):
        >>>	print('making green')
        >>>     fact['light_color'] = 'green'
        >>>     wm.update_fact(fact)
        >>> 
        >>> @Skill(V('fact') << Fact(light_color="green"))
        >>> def make_red(fact):
        >>>	print('making red')
        >>>     fact['light_color'] = 'red'
        >>>     wm.update_fact(fact)
        >>> 
        >>> light_wm = WorkingMemory()
        >>> light_wm.add_fact(f1)
        >>> light_wm.add_skill(make_green)
        >>> light_wm.add_skill(make_red)
        ```
        
        Once the above fact and skills have been added the working memory can be run.
        ```python
        >>> light_wm.run(5)
        making green
        making red
        making green
        making red
        making green
        ```
        
        The number passed to run denotes how many rules the working memory should fire
        before terminating.
        
        In addition to this high-level function for running the working memory, there
        are also some lower-level capabilities that can be used to more closely control
        the rule execution.
        
        For example, you can get all the skill matches.
        ```python
        matches = [match for match in light_wm.get_skill_matches()]
        ```
        
        You can fire one of the matches.
        ```python
        matches[0].fire()
        ```
