Description: # Toggl Dashboard
        #### This small project helps you run a Dash app on localhost, in which you can see where you time has been used using data from Toggl track. Its just a more comprehensive report of your data. 
        #### You can see the the project on [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/toggldash/) too. In order to run the program, install the package using the code below:
        
        ```
        pip install toggldash
        ```
        </br>
        
        #### You can run the dashboard using the python code below:
        ```python
        from toggldash import app
        app.run()
        ```
        </br>
        
        #### The program then asks you your toggl credentials. It saves them in a file in your current directory called creds.txt. The file will look something like this
        ```

        ```
        
        #### Or you can just create a file with the creds in it. The above creds won't work.
        #### By default the app will run on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
