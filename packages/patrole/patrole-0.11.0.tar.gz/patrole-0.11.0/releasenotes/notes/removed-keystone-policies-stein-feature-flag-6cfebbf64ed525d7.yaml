    Added new feature flag called ``removed_keystone_policies_stein`` under
    the configuration group ``[policy-feature-enabled]`` for skipping Keystone
    tests whose policies were removed in Stein. This feature flag is currently
    applied to credentials-related policies, e.g.:
    identity:[create|update|get|delete]_credential
