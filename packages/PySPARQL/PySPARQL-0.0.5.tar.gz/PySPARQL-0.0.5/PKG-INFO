        |Documentation Status|
        
        This is a simple module that allows developer to query SPARQL endpoints
        and analyze the results with Apache Spark. In particular, if a
        **SELECT** query is used, a **DataFrame** is returned, while if a
        **CONSTRUCT** query is used, a **GraphFrame** is returned. You can find
        the documentation `here <https://PySPARQL.readthedocs.io/>`__.
        
        Build
        -----
        
        To generate a ``.whl`` file just type ``make build``, and the file will
        be generated under ``dist`` folder.
        
        Test
        ----
        
        To properly test the library a SPARQL endpoint is needed. Navigate to
        ``deplyoment`` folder and start a Jena-Fuseky component with the command
        ``docker-compose up -d``. A simple, hand made, **FOAF** ontology with
        few individuals is loaded in Jena-Fuseki. You are encouraged to
        experiment with the SPARQL endpoint availabe at
        `localhost <http://localhost:3030>`__.
        
        After starting Jena-Fuseki, navigate back to the main folder, and type
        ``make docker-test`` to start the test phase.
