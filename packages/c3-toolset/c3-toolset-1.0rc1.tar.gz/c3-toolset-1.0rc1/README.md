# C3 - An integrated tool-set for Control, Calibration and Characterization

The C3 package is intended to close the loop between open-loop control optimization, control pulse calibration, and model-matching based on calibration data.

C3  provides a simple Python API through which it may integrate with virtually any experimental setup.
