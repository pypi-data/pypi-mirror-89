User visible changes:

New tag 'Effort estimation' was added.  This makes it possible to get
an impression about the remaining work to do.  Effort estimation is
also included in the priority lists.  It is directly shown how much
effort it is to implement everything up to a certain priority.

Status values changed from 'open' to 'not done' and from 'completed'
to finished.  This wording fits better for implementation and
requirements elaboration.

A man page was added which describes the format of the requirements
input file (rmtoo-req-format.5).  Add man page for rmtoo incvocation
(rmtoo-invoking.1). 

Requirements with Class implementable are drawn as octogons in the
requirements dependency graph.

HTML home page is now included in the repository.

Tests included: 83 unit- and regression tests are now included.  It is
possible to run the tests after installing the package to check if
everything works.  Currently there is a test coverage of about 74%. 

Debian package available starting with this release.


Internal Changes:

Interface of Requirement Tag module classes changed: this improves the
error handling.
