Getting started with INDRA
==========================

Importing INDRA and its modules
-------------------------------
INDRA can be imported and used in a Python script or interactively
in a Python shell. Note that similar to some other packages (e.g scipy), INDRA
doesn't automatically import all its submodules, so
`import indra` is not enough to access its submodules.
Rather, one has to explicitly import each submodule that is needed.
For example to access the BEL API, one has to

.. code:: python

    from indra.sources import bel

Similarly, each model output assembler has its own submodule under
`indra.assemblers` with the assembler class accessible at the submodule
level, so they can be imported as, for instance,

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    from indra.assemblers.pysb import PysbAssembler

To get a detailed overview of INDRA's submodule structure, take a look at
the :ref:`indra_modules_ref`.

Basic usage examples
--------------------

Here we show some basic usage examples of the submodules of INDRA. More complex
usage examples are shown in the Tutorials section.

Reading a sentence with TRIPS
`````````````````````````````
In this example, we read a sentence via INDRA's TRIPS submodule to produce
an INDRA Statement.

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    from indra.sources import trips
    sentence = 'MAP2K1 phosphorylates MAPK3 at Thr-202 and Tyr-204'
    trips_processor = trips.process_text(sentence)

The `trips_processor` object has a `statements` attribute which contains a list
of INDRA Statements extracted from the sentence.

Reading a PubMed Central article with REACH
```````````````````````````````````````````
In this example, a full paper from `PubMed
Central <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/>`_ is processed. The paper's PMC ID is
`PMC3717945 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3717945/>`_.

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    from indra.sources import reach
    reach_processor = reach.process_pmc('3717945')

The `reach_processor` object has a `statements` attribute which contains a list
of INDRA Statements extracted from the paper.

Getting the neighborhood of proteins from the BEL Large Corpus
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
In this example, we search the neighborhood of the KRAS and BRAF proteins in
the BEL Large Corpus.

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    from indra.sources import bel
    bel_processor = bel.process_pybel_neighborhood(['KRAS', 'BRAF'])

The `bel_processor` object has a `statements` attribute which contains a list
of INDRA Statements extracted from the queried neighborhood.

Constructing INDRA Statements manually
``````````````````````````````````````
It is possible to construct INDRA Statements manually or in scripts. The following
is a basic example in which we instantiate a Phosphorylation Statement between
BRAF and MAP2K1.

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    from indra.statements import Phosphorylation, Agent
    braf = Agent('BRAF')
    map2k1 = Agent('MAP2K1')
    stmt = Phosphorylation(braf, map2k1)

Assembling a PySB model and exporting to SBML
`````````````````````````````````````````````
In this example, assume that we have already collected a list of INDRA Statements
from any of the input sources and that this list is called `stmts`. We will
instantiate a PysbAssembler, which produces a PySB model from INDRA Statements.

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    from indra.assemblers.pysb import PysbAssembler
    pa = PysbAssembler()
    pa.add_statements(stmts)
    model = pa.make_model()

Here the `model` variable is a PySB Model object representing a rule-based
executable model, which can be further manipulated, simulated, saved and exported
to other formats.

For instance, exporting the model to `SBML <http://sbml.org>`_ format can
be done as

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    sbml_model = pa.export_model('sbml')

which gives an SBML model string in the `sbml_model` variable, or as

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    pa.export_model('sbml', file_name='model.sbml')

which writes the SBML model into the `model.sbml` file. Other formats for export
that are supported include BNGL, Kappa and Matlab. For a full list, see the
`PySB export module
<http://docs.pysb.org/en/latest/modules/export/index.html>`_.

Exporting Statements as an IndraNet Graph
`````````````````````````````````````````
In this example we again assume that there already exists a variable called
`stmts`, containing a list of statements. We will import the
`IndraNetAssembler` that produces an IndraNet object, which is a networkx
MultiDiGraph representations of the statements, each edge representing a
statement and each node being an agent.

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    from indra.assemblers.indranet import IndraNetAssembler
    indranet_assembler = IndraNetAssembler(statements=stmts)
    indranet = indranet_assembler.make_model()

The `indranet` object is an instance of a child class of a networkx graph
object, making all networkx graph methods available for the indranet object.
Each edge in the has an edge dictionary with meta data from the statement.

The `indranet` graph has methods to map it to other graph types. Here we
export it to a signed graph which is represents directed edges with positive
or negative polarity signs:

.. Also update code in tests/test_docs_code.py:test_getting_started

.. code:: python

    signed_graph = indranet.to_signed_graph()
