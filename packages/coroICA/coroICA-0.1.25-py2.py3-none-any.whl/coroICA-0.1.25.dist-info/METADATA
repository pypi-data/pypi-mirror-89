==============

Please refer to the project website at https://sweichwald.de/coroICA/.
We kindly ask you to cite the accompanying article (see below), in case
this package should prove useful for some work you are publishing.

Quick install

::

    pip install coroICA

The developer documentation is available at
https://sweichwald.de/coroICA-python.

This repository holds the source of the `coroICA
package <https://pypi.org/project/coroICA/>`__ which implements the
coroICA algorithm presented in `Robustifying Independent Component
Analysis by Adjusting for Group-Wise Stationary
Noise <https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01094>`__ by N Pfister\ *, S
Weichwald*, P Bühlmann, B Schölkopf.

Furthermore, as a courtesy to other python users, this package contains
implementations of \* uwedge, an approximate matrix joint
diagonalisation algorithm described
`here <https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2009271>`__, and \*
``uwedgeICA``, which essentially—for the right choice of ``timelag``
parameters—amounts to an implementation of several
second-order-statistics-based ICA algorithms such as
SOBI/NSS-JD/NSS-TD-JD (please refer to the coroICA website and article
mentioned above for more details on this),

which may be helpful in their own right independent of the
confounding-robust ICA.
