# Ivy Used CMS Scanner

## About
Large AxonIvy projects usually have huge number amount of CMSs, and overtime, after countless times
of adding, updating and removing the CMSs, there will be `zoombie` CMSs in your code base.

The idea of this tool is pretty simple:

>In each project:
>  - List out all *.data and co.meta files
>  - Group the *.data files with their corresponding co.meta file
>  - Search the CMS in [*.java, *.drl, *.xhtml, *.mod] files using >  - CMS's path (example: /fintech/soba/authentication/message/accessdenied)
>  - If no result found -> CMS is not being used
