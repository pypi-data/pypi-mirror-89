        ## About
        
        I started writing `ToyDB` as a _toy_ project, in order to get a better sense of
        how RDBMSs work.
        
        My goal isn't to write a high-performance database or even necessarily to finish
        `ToyDB` -- it's to continue to get a better understanding of the inner workings
        of a database.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `ToyDB` can be installed using PyPi:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install toydb
        ```
        
        ## Status
        
        __NOTE: Still in development.__
        
        - [x] Write the framework
        - [x] Layout the DB directory structure and file format
        - [ ] Write a SQL parser
        - [ ] Write a query function
        - [ ] Table Join functionality
        
        ## Feedback
        
        I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on `ToyDB`.
