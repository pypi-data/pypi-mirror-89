    Add new exception called ``RbacOverrideRoleException``. Used for
    safeguarding against false positives that might occur when the expected
    exception isn't raised inside the ``override_role`` context. Specifically,
    when:

    * ``override_role`` isn't called
    * an exception is raised before ``override_role`` context
    * an exception is raised after ``override_role`` context

    Previously, the ``rbac_rule_validation.action`` decorator could catch
    expected exceptions with no regard to where the error happened. Such
    behavior could cause false-positive results. To prevent this from
    happening from now on, if an exception happens outside of the
    ``override_role`` context, it will cause
    ``rbac_exceptions.RbacOverrideRoleException`` to be raised.
