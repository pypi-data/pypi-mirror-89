Flask-SSPI
==========

Flask-SSPI is an extension to `Flask`_ that allows you to trivially add
`NTLM`_ based authentication to your website. It depends on both Flask and
`sspi`_. You can install the requirements from PyPI with
`easy_install` or `pip` or `conda`, or download them by hand.

The official copy of this documentation is available at `Read the Docs`_.

Installation
------------

Install the extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install Flask-SSPI

or alternatively if you have `pip` installed::

    $ pip install Flask-SSPI

or using `conda`::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge flask-sspi

Limitations
-----------

Based on win32 so only works on Windows servers.

Tested with Chrome and Edge browsers. 

Only `NTLM`_ authentication as been implemented, 'Negotiate' (`Kerberos`_) as not been implemented. 


How to Use
----------

First Form (prefered)
.....................

You can decorate any view functions you wish to require authentication with the
@authenticate. To get the current user you can use g.current_user::

    from flask-sspi import authenticate
    from flask import g

    @app.route("/protected/<path:path>")
    @authenticate
    def protected_view(path):
        print(g.current_user)
        ...


Second Form
...........

You can decorate any view functions you wish to require authentication with @requires_authentication, 
with this keyword, you need to change them to accept the authenticated user principal as their first 
argument::

    from flask-sspi import requires_authentication

    @app.route("/protected/<path:path>")
    @requires_authentication
    def protected_view(user, path):
        ...



Flask-SSPI assumes that the service will be running using the hostname of
the host on which the application is run. If this is not the case, you can
override it by initializing the module::

    from flask-sspi import init_sspi
    
    init_sspi(app, hostname='example.com', package='NTLM')

NOTE: 'init_sspi' is optionnal. If used, current_user will be defined 
within context of jinja templates. You can then use::

   ...
   <h1> Hello {{ current_user }} </h1>
   ...


How it works
------------

When a protected view is accessed by a client, it will check to see if the
request includes authentication credentials in an `Authorization` header. If
there are no such credentials, the application will respond immediately with a
`401 Unauthorized` response which includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field
with a value of `NTLM` indicating to the client that they are currently
unauthorized, but that they can authenticate using Negotiate authentication.

If credentials are presented in the `Authorization` header, the credentials will
be validated, the principal of the authenticating user will be extracted, and
the protected view will be called with the extracted principal passed in as the
first argument.

Once the protected view returns, a ``WWW-Authenticate`` header will be added to
the response which can then be used by the client to authenticate the server.
This is known as mutual authentication.

SSPI also has the ability to serve the value ``Negotiate`` from the `WWW-Authenticate` 
header. This as not been implemented but could be in the future with the help of the 
community.

Decorators that can be used
---------------------------

========================== ===========
Decorator                  Description     
========================== ===========
@authenticate              The user must have been identified.
Impersonate                Context class to impersonate the connecting user: The user's 
                           credentials will be used to execute the route function. Use 
                           this to access a database under the user's name per example.
@requires_authentication   Same as login_required but the ``user`` parameter needs to be 
                           specified in the arguments of the route function. **user** will contain the name
                           of the logger user. Kept for backward compatibility.
========================== ===========

For all ``flask_sspi`` decorators, a ``g.current_user`` entry is created and accessible 
within the route function. Within html templates the variable current_user is also 
defined if init_sspi is used.

Using before_request function for Blueprints
--------------------------------------------

If you want to restrict access to a whole Blueprint, better to do it with the 
before_request function. Here is an example::

   @blueprint.before_request
   @authenticate
   def before_request():
     pass

Offsite debugging
-----------------

You may want to test your ``flask`` application offsite in a non-domain environment. To allow testing 
without error from ``flask_sspi`` you can issue ``import flask_sspi_fake`` before any reference to 
``flask_sspi``. ``flask_sspi_fake`` will use stubs instead of the real functions and allow the site
to be tested under the credentials of the currently logged user.
