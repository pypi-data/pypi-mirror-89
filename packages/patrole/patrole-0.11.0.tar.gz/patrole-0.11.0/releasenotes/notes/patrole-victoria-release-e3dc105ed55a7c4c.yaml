prelude: |
    This release is to tag the Patrole for OpenStack Victoria release.
    This release marks the start of Victoria release support in Patrole.
    After this release, Patrole will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Victoria
    * Ussuri
    * Train
    * Stein

    Current development of Patrole is for OpenStack Wallaby development
    cycle. Every Patrole commit is also tested against master during
    the Wallaby cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Patrole as of this tag will work against a Wallaby (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Victoria release.
