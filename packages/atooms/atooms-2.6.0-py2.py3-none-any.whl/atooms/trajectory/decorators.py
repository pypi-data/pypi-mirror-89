"""
Trajectory callbacks and class decorators.

- "Callbacks" are simple functions that modify the `system` instance
  returned by `read_sample()`. They can be registered to `trajectory`
  instance via `add_callback()`.
- "Class decorators" can be used for
  more complex modifications of trajectory behavior.
