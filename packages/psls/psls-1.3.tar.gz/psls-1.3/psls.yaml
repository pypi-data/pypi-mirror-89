# Observation conditions
Observation:
  Duration : 190. #  [days]
  MasterSeed : 1704040900 # Master seed of the pseudo-random number generator

# Instrument parameters
Instrument:
  Sampling : 25. # Sampling  cadence [s] (nominal value: 25s)
  IntegrationTime : 21. # Integration time [s]
  NGroup : 4 # Number of camera groups (1 -> 4)
  NCamera : 6 # Number of cameras per group (1 -> 6)

  RandomNoise:

    Type: PLATO_SIMU #  either 'User' or 'PLATO_SCALING' or 'PLATO_SIMU'.
# 'User': the NSR value is specified by the user (see below) 
# 'PLATO_SCALING': the NSR value is obtained by interpolating, at the given magnitude, the NSR scaling relation expected for PLATO
# 'PLATO_SIMU': the NSR is taken from realistic simulated ligth-curves (stored in the systematics error table, see below) and vary with the mask shapes and thus then the latter are updated
    NSR :  73. # User-specified Noise to Signal Ratio [ppm in one hour] for a single camera. This value takes into account all random noises but does not include systematic errors.
  Systematics:
    Enable : 1
# The binary file containing the systematics parameters:
    Table : systematics/PLATO_systematics_BOL_V2.npy  # representative for the sample P5 stars, with mask updates during the quarter
#    Table :  systematics/PLATO_systematics_BOL_FixedMask_V2.npy # representative for the sample P5 stars, with fixed mask during the quarter
#    Table :  systematics/PLATO_systematics_BOL_P1_V2.npy # representative for the sample P1 stars
    Version: 2  # Version of the table
    DriftLevel: medium  # Amplitude of the drift:  'min', 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'max' or 'any'. Applicable only for Version>0

# Stellar parameters
Star:
  Mag : 10. #  V magnitude (John V magnitude). The V magnitude is converted into the PLATO P magnitude using the star effective temperature following Marchiori et al (2019, A&A)'s Teff-magnitude relation.
