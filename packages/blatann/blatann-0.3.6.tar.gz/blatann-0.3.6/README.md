# Blatann

bl√•tann: Norwegian word for "blue tooth"

The goal of this library is to provide a high-level, object-oriented interface
for performing bluetooth operations using the Nordic nRF52 through Nordic's `pc-ble-driver-py` library
and the associated Connectivity firmware.

Documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://blatann.readthedocs.io)

### Install

`pip install blatann`

#### Supported Devices/Software

This library has been tested using both the nRF52 Dev Kits, the nRF52840 USB Dongle and the [ABSniffer 528](https://blog.aprbrother.com/product/absniffer-usb-dongle-528) flashed with Connectivity Firmware

**Supported Versions:**

\* I have not personally tested the nRF52840 compatibility for v0.2.x, only heard second-hand accounts of it working. v0.3+ has been tested with the nRF52840 USB Dongle

When using the nRF52840, it should be flashed using the S132/SoftDevice v5 connectivity images. Both hex files and DFU packages are distributed by default
with v4.1.1 of [pc-ble-driver](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-ble-driver/releases/tag/v4.1.1) and is also bundled with `pc-ble-driver-py` install,
allowing the Dev Kit and USB Dongle to be flashed. The devices can be updated using [nRF Connect Desktop App](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop)

### Roadmap

**NOTE**

As of v0.3.0, the public-facing API is stable. There is not likely to be any major changes in method/property naming or functionality
and all features added will aim to maintain backwards compatibility.

The library aims to support both event-driven and procedural program styles. It takes similar paradigms from C#/.NET's event function signatures,
where event handlers are passed  `object sender, EventArgs e` parameters.
Additionally, all asynchronous function calls return a `Waitable` object which can be waited on (with timeout)
until the event associated with the function call returns.

### Examples

There are several example scripts which showcase different functionality of the library under `blatann/examples`.
Examples can be run using `python -m blatann.examples [example_filename] [device_comport]`.

Example usage: `python -m blatann.examples scanner COM3`

### Running Tests

The integrated tests can be ran using the builtin `unittest` runner and depends on a few environment variables to find the connected Nordic devices.

At a minimum, two nordic devices are required to run the unit tests. These are specified using environment variables:

- `BLATANN_DEV_1` - Serial port of the first Nordic device
- `BLATANN_DEV_2` - Serial port of the second Nordic device

Optionally a third `BLATANN_DEV_3` can be specified to run tests which require more than two devices. If this environment variable is not defined, tests which require 3 devices are skipped.

In order to speed up the tests, `BLATANN_TEST_QUICK=1` can be defined to skip long-running tests. 
Note that test cases which are defined as "long-running" is subjective and relative--the test suite will still take awhile to run, 
but in general test cases which take longer than 20 seconds are skipped.

The tests can also be ran through the makefile using `make run-tests`.
