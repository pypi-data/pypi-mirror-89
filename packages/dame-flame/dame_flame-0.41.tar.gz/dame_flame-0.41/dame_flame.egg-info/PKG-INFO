        # DAME-FLAME
        A Python package for performing matching for observational causal inference on datasets containing discrete covariates
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        ## Documentation [here](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/DAME-FLAME-Python-Package/)
        
        DAME-FLAME is a Python package for performing matching for observational causal inference on datasets containing discrete covariates. It implements the Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME) and Fast, Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME) algorithms, which match treatment and control units on subsets of the covariates. The resulting matched groups are interpretable, because the matches are made on covariates, and high-quality, because machine learning is used to determine which covariates are important to match on.
        
        ### Installation
        
        #### Dependencies
        `dame-flame` requires Python version (>=3.6.5). Install from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.
        
        - pandas>=0.11.0
        - numpy>= 1.16.5
        - scikit-learn>=0.23.2
        
        
        If your python version does not have these packages, install from [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).
        
        To run the examples in the examples folder (these are not part of the package), Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab (available [here](https://jupyter.org/install)) and Matplotlib (>=2.0.0) is also required.
        
        #### User Installation
        
        Download from PyPi via
        $ pip install dame-flame
