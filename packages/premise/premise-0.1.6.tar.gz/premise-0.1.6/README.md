[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/romainsacchi/premise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/romainsacchi/premise) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/romainsacchi/premise/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/romainsacchi/premise?branch=master) [![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/premise/badge/?version=latest)](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/premise.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/premise)


Introduction
============

**premise** allows to align the life cycle inventories contained in the **ecoinvent 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 cutoff** databases with
the output results of Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) **REMIND** and **IMAGE**, in order to produce life cycle inventories under
future policy scenarios (from business-as-usual to very ambitious climate scenarios) for any year between 2005 and 2100.

Inputs
------

Either:
* ecoinvent v.3.5, 3.6 or 3.7 as a registered brightway2 database
* ecoinvent v.3.5, 3.6 or 3.7 as ecospold files

Transformations
---------------

More specifically, **premise** will apply a series of transformation functions to ecoinvent.

In the latest version (0.1.7), the following transformation functions are available:

* **update_electricity_to_iam_data()**: alignment of regional electricity production mixes as well as efficiencies for a number of
electricity production technologies, including Carbon Capture and Storage technologies.
* **update_cars()**: fuel markets that supply transport vehicles are adjusted according to the IAM projections,
including penetration of bio- and synthetic fuels.
* **update_cement_to_iam_data()**: adjustment of technologies for cement production (dry, semi-dry, wet, with pre-heater or not),
fuel efficiency of kilns, fuel mix of kilns (including biomass and waste fuels) and clinker-to-cement ratio.
* **update_steel_to_iam_data()**: adjustment of process efficiency, fuel mix and share of secondary steel in steel markets.

However, whether or not these transformation functions can be applied will depend on the existence of the necessary variables in
the IAM file you use as input.

The following REMIND IAM files come with the library:

* SSP2
    1.  **Base:** counter-factual scenario with no climate policy implemented
    2.  **NPi** (*N*ational *P*olicies *i*mplemented): scenario  describes energy,  climate  and  economic  projections for the  period  until 2030, and equivalent efforts thereafter. See [CD-LINKS modelling protocol](https://www.cd-links.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CD-LINKS-global-exercise-protocol_secondround_for-website.pdf) for details.
    3.  **NDC**: All emission reductions and other mitigation commitments of the *N*ationally*D*etermined *C*ontributions under the Paris Agreement are implemented. See [CD-LINKS modelling protocol](https://www.cd-links.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CD-LINKS-global-exercise-protocol_secondround_for-website.pdf) for details.
    4.  **PkBudg 1300/1100/900**: Climate policies to limit cumulative 2011-2100 CO2 emissions to 1300 / 1100 / 900 over the entire time horizon (“not-to-exceed”). Correspond to 2°, well-below 2° and 1.5° targets. Other greenhouse gases are priced with the CO2e-price using 100year global warming potentials.

The following IMAGE IAM file comes with the library:

* SSP2
    1.  **Base** counter-factual scenario with no climate policy implemented

You can however use any other IAM files.

Additionally, a number of inventories for emerging technologies are added upon the creation of a new database.

* electricity production using various fuels (including biomass and biogas) with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) [Volkart et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.03.003)
* hydrogen production from electrolysis from different world regions,

How to install this package?
----------------------------

Two options:

A development version with the latest advancements (but with the risks of unseen bugs),
is available on Conda:

    conda install premise

For a more stable and proven version, from Pypi:

    pip install premise

will install the package and the required dependencies.

How to use it?
--------------

### Extract (using brightway2)

A preliminary requirement to the use this library is to have a `brightway2` project created and opened, with the
`ecoinvent 3.5 cutoff`, `ecoinvent 3.6 cutoff` or `ecoinvent 3.7 cutoff` database registered, so that:

```python

    import brightway2 as bw
    bw.projects.set_current('remind')
    list(bw.databases)
```
returns
```
    Databases dictionary with 2 object(s):
	biosphere3
	ecoinvent 3.5 cutoff
```
Then, for a chosen policy and year between 2005 and 2150, the following function will:
* extract the ecoinvent database, clean it, add additional inventories for carbon capture and storage, biofuels, etc.

For example, here with the year 2028 and a baseline variant of a "middle of the road" socioeconomic pathway called "SSP2-Base":
```python
    from premise import *
    ndb = NewDatabase(scenario = 'SSP2-Base',
              year = 2028,
              source_db = 'ecoinvent 3.7 cutoff',
              source_version = 3.7,
             )
```
The current variants available of SSP2 are:
* SSP2-Base: counterfactual scenario with no climate policy implementation.
* SSP2-NPi: NPi (National Policies implemented) scenario  describes energy, climate and economic projections for the period until 2030, and equivalent efforts thereafter.
* SSP2-NDC: All emission reductions and other mitigation commitments of the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement are implemented.
* SSP2-PkBudg900, SSP2-PkBudg1100, SSP2-PkBudg1300: PkBudg 1300/1100/900: Climate policies to limit cumulative 2011-2100 CO2 emissions to 1300/1100/900 gigatons over the entire time horizon (not-to-exceed). Correspond to 2°, well-below 2° and 1.5° targets respectively. Other greenhouse gases are priced with the CO2e-price using 100year global warming potentials.

Further description of those scenarios is provided [here](https://github.com/romainsacchi/premise/blob/master/premise/data/remind_output_files/description.md).

Note that, by default, the library will look for REMIND output files ("xxx.mif" files and "GAINS emission factors.csv") in the
"data/remind_output_files" subdirectory. If those are not located there, you need to specify the path to
the correct directory, as such::
```python
    from premise import *
    
    ndb = NewDatabase(
        model="remind",
        scenario="SSP2-NPi",
        year=2050,
        source_db="ecoinvent 3.7 cutoff",
        source_version=3,
        filepath_to_iam_files=r"C:\Users\username\Documents\Remind output files"
             )
```

### Extract (without brightway2)

If you are not using brightway2, you may load the ecoinvent database
from its *ecospold2* files (available from the ecoinvent website),
like shown in the example below, by specifying `source_type = 'ecospold'`
and the file path to the ecospold files in `source_file_path`.

```python
    from premise import *
    ndb = NewDatabase(scenario = 'SSP2-Base',
                  year = 2028,
                  source_db = 'ecoinvent 3.5 cutoff',
                  source_version = 3.5,
                  source_type = 'ecospold',
                  source_file_path = r"C:\Users\path\ecoinvent 3.5_cutoff_ecoSpold02\datasets"
                 )
```


### Transform

A series of transformations can be performed on the extracted database.
Currently, only the transformation regarding:
* electricity generation and distribution


is implemented.

All the transformation functions can be executed like so:

```python
    ndb.update_all()
```

But they can also be executed separately, as the following subsections show.

#### Electricity

The following function will:
* remove existing electricity markets
* replace them by regional markets (high, medium and low voltage) with a geographical scope and production mix
  defined by the REMIND model for that year,
* relink electricity-consuming activities to the newly created electricity markets,
* update the efficiency of electricity-producing technologies (fuel-input-to-energy-output ratio),
according to the projections given by REMIND,
* and rescale fuel-related emissions of electricity-producing technologies according to their newly defined efficiency.


```python
    ndb.update_electricity_to_iam_data()
```


Note that logs of:
* deleted and created electricity markets
* changes in efficiencies for each power plant
are created in the `data/logs/` directory as MS Excel files, within premise working directory.

#### Cement (not available yet)

The following function will:
* remove existing datasets for clinker production, clinker markets, cement production and cement markets
* replace them by regional production and market datasets
* for the new clinker production datasets, the following aspects are adjusted:
  * the kiln technology mix (wet vs. semi-wet vs. dry, with or without pre-heater and pre-calciner),
  * the kiln thermal efficiency,
  * the fuel mix (fossil vs. biogenic),
  * the fossil and biogenic CO2 emissions,
  * the emission of pollutants (BC, CO, Hg, etc.)
  * and the application of carbon capture, if needed
* for the new cement production datasets, the following aspects are adjusted: the power consumption (for grinding)
* for the new market datasets for average cement, the clinker-to-cement ratio is adjusted
* and relink cement-consuming activities to the newly created cement markets.

```python
    ndb.update_cement_to_iam_data()
```

Note that logs of deleted and created clinker and cement datasets are created in
the `data/logs/` directory as MS Excel files, within premise working directory.

### Load (export back to brightway2)

Once the process is completed, the resulting database is registered back into the current Brightway2 project:
```python
    ndb.write_db_to_brightway()
```
returns
```
    Write new database to Brightway2.
    15223 datasets
    540424 exchanges
    0 unlinked exchanges

    Writing activities to SQLite3 database:
    Created database: ecoinvent_BAU_2028
```

### Load (export to matrices)

If you do not use brightway2, it is possible to export the transformed database into matrices.

```python
    ndb.write_db_to_matrices()
```
returns
```
    Write new database to matrix.
    Matrices saved in C:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub\premise\premise\data\matrices.
```

Two matrices are created:
* matrix A: contains product exchanges
* matrix B: contains exchanges between activities and the biosphere

Two other files are exported:
* A_matrix_index: maps row/column index of A_matrix to activity label
* B_matrix_index: maps row index of B_matrix to biosphere flow label

The column indices of B_matrix are similar to the row/column indices of A_matrix.
