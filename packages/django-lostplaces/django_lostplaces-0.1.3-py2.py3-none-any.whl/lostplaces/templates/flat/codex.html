    <p>This should be pretty self-explanatory, right? But as you all know, every sign has a history. We have seen too much senseless destruction so we decided to write down a basic Urban Exploration codex.</p>
    <ul class="LP-UnorderedList">
        <li>
            <b>We respect other people's property</b>, just as we demand it from others. Therefore we do not open access by force, or damage a locking device. We only enter a property or a building / a facility / a ruin if we can assume that we am not there against the will of the owner. A well-preserved fence or a permanent guard indicates that the owner is still dealing with his property. Fences that have long since collapsed, ruins in the final stages of decay, are more likely to indicate that the owner doesn't care.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We take nothing from a location</b>, not even "small souvenirs", and leave nothing there — no cigarettes, no waste — nothing. 
            <b>We do not change anything in the location.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We don't smoke if possible.</b> Not only, because it smells bad and causes litter, there is always the chance, to set anything on fire with flying sparks. Let it be dry leaves on a hot summer day or (poentially) flammable materials in industrial plants.
        </li>
        <li>    
            <b>Spraying is an absolute "no-go"!</b>
        </li>
        <li>    
            <b>In a location we are careful not to endanger ourselves or others.</b> We don't throw anything into holes or out of windows, and we don't touch electrical equipment. You can't tell from its look or sound if the power is really switched off. Therefore we do not open bottles and other containers. We never go into a dark room without light, and always have a spare lamp with us.
        </li>
        <li>    
            <b>Before our tour we tell at least one person of our trust where we are</b> (coordinates!), how long we will be there and what we will do there. We arrange that we will contact him regularly if we stay there for a longer period of time, or give an "okay" when we have left the location again. If we am late, we will remember to send a message to that effect. Our contact person is supposed to provide help after a certain period of time if he does not hear from me.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We prepare out tour carefully.</b> It is annoying when the camera batteries are not charged — but it is not dangerous at all. But it is life-threatening if you step unto a dirty nail that perforates your shoe. It is wise to wear sturdy shoes. When we go underground, we take appropiate equipment with us to protect ourselves — e. g. a gas warner or even a geiger counter.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We do not park in such a way that third parties become aware of our intention.</b> Our hobby does not need public attention, which is directed to illegal entering of properties (and illegal entering is probably the most common way ...).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We do not disclose our locations</b> and only publish photos where geodata has been removed from the files (EXIF). Therefore we only post from our smartphone when we am absolutely sure that no coordinates are contained in the picture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Above all, we keep our mouth shut</b> and don't brag about a great, still untouched looking location. You often don't even know your "friends" in Facebook personally, especially not in a group. Nothing spreads faster than a "secret" that has been passed on under the seal of trust. Do you want to be responsible for brainless sprayers destroying this place too?
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We make sure through argument and conviction that our companions behave the same way!</b> First and foremost we try to convince through our own behavior.
        </li>
    </ul>
