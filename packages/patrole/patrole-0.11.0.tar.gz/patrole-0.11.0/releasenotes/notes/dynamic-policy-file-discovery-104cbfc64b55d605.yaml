features:
  - |
    Add new configuration option ``[rbac] custom_policy_files``,
    allowing users to specify list of the paths to search for custom
    policy files. Each policy path assumes that the service name is
    included in the path once. Also assumes Patrole is on the same host
    as the policy files. The paths should be ordered by precedence, with
    high-priority paths before low-priority paths. The first path that
    is found to contain the service's policy file will be used.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate the following configuration options from ``[rbac]`` group:

    * cinder_policy_file
    * glance_policy_file
    * keystone_policy_file
    * neutron_policy_file
    * nova_policy_file

    It is better to use ``[rbac] custom_policy_files`` which supports
    any OpenStack service.
