urlwatch is intended to help you watch changes in webpages and get
notified (via e-mail, in your terminal or through various third party
services) of any changes. The change notification will include the URL
that has changed and a unified diff of what has changed.

Quick Start
===========

1. Run ``urlwatch`` once to migrate your old data or start fresh
2. Use ``urlwatch --edit`` to customize your job list (this will
   create/edit ``urls.yaml``)
3. Use ``urlwatch --edit-config`` if you want to set up e-mail sending
4. Add ``urlwatch`` to your crontab (``crontab -e``) to monitor webpages
   periodically

The checking interval is defined by how often you run ``urlwatch``. You
can use e.g.Â `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru>`__ to figure out the
schedule expression for the checking interval, we recommend not more
often than 30 minutes (this would be ``*/30 * * * *``). If you have
never used cron before, check out the `crontab command
help <https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm>`__.

On Windows, ``cron`` is not installed by default. Use the `Windows Task
Scheduler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler>`__
instead, or see `this StackOverflow
question <https://stackoverflow.com/q/132971/1047040>`__ for
alternatives.
