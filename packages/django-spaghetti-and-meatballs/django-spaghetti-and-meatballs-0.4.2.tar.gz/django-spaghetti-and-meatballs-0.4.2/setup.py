If its `not` in here it `won\'t be seen`.\n* ``show_fields`` is a boolean that states if the field names should be shown in the graph or just in the however over. For small graphs, you can set this to `True` to show fields as well, but as you get more models it gets messier.\n* ``exclude`` is a dictionary where each key is an ``app_label`` and the items for that key are model names to hide in the graph. \n\nIf its not working as expected make sure your app labels and model names are all **lower case**.\n\n\nServe your plate in your urls file\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nOnce you\'ve configured your sauce, make sure you serve up a plate of spaghetti in your ``urls.py`` like so:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    urlpatterns += patterns(\'\',\n        url(r\'^plate/\', include(\'django_spaghetti.urls\')),\n    )\n\nA sample platter\n----------------\n\nBelow is an example image showing the connections between models from the \n`django-reversion <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion>`_ and \n`django-notifications <https://github.com/django-notifications/django-notifications>`_ \napps and Django\'s built-in ``auth`` models.\n\nColored edges illustrate foreign key relations, with arrows pointing from the defining \nmodel to the related model, while gray edges illustrate many-to-many relations. \nDifferent colors signify the different Django apps, and when relations link between \napps the edges are colored with a gradient.\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2173174/9053053/a45e185c-3ab2-11e5-9ea0-89dafb7ac274.png\n\nHovering over a model, gives a pop-up that lists the following information:\n\n* model name\n* app label\n* The models docstring\n* A list of every field, with its field type and its help text (if defined). Unique fields have their name underlined.\n\nThis was build with the sauce:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  SPAGHETTI_SAUCE = {\n      \'apps\': [\'auth\', \'notifications\', \'reversion\'],\n      \'show_fields\': False,\n  }\n\nA complex live-demo\n-------------------\n\nTo see a complex example, where ``django-spaghetti-and-meatballs`` really shines,\ncheckout the live version built for the `Aristotle Metadata Registry <http://registry.aristotlemetadata.com/labs/plate/>`_\n\nTesting and developing\n----------------------\n\nI like keeping my development environments isolated in docker. You can too. If you want to install `poetry` locally, you can skip this bit.\n\n* Build a container with Pythong and Poetry installed - `docker build . -t spaghetti`\n* Run a container for developing `docker run -v "$(realpath .)":/site -w /site -p 8000:8000 -it --rm spaghetti bash`\n\n* Install the dependencies - `poetry install`\n* Open a poetry shell - `poetry shell`\n* Run the server - `django-admin runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`\n\nIf you navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000` should should see the demo app.\n\n.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: https://django-spaghetti-and-meatballs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n    :alt: Documentation Status\n\n.. |code-climate| image:: https://codeclimate.com/github/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs/badges/gpa.svg\n   :target: https://codeclimate.com/github/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs\n   :alt: Code Climate\n\n.. |coveralls| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs?branch=master\n\n.. |travis| image:: https://travis-ci.org/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs\n\n',
