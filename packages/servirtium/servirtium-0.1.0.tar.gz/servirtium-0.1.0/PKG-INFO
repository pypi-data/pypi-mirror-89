        # A Servirtium library for Python 
        
        Demo project that uses it: https://github.com/servirtium/demo-python-climate-data-tck 
        
        ## Alpha quality software
        
        Working so far:
        
        * Record and playback of GET/POST/PUT
        
        Not Working yet:
        
        * Support for "Transfer-Encoding" header for "chunked" response
        
        Help needed from Pythonistas!
        
        ## Building Servirtium lib/package for Python3
        
        Execute the following commands to install the package locally:
        
        ```
        pip3 install requests
        cd servirtium-python
        pip3 install -e .
        ```
        
        OR install it from https://pypi.org/ using following:
        ```
        pip3 install servirtium
        ```
        
        The 'demo-python-climate-data-tck' demo needs you to have built the Python version of Servirtium 
        first as it is presently unpublished in pip-land.
        
        ## Running unit tests
        
        ```
        pip3 install pytest
        cd servirtium-python
        pytest
        ```
        
        ## Running the compatibility suite
        
        This should record a bunch of interactions, using a Mocha test suite that we launch via Selenium-WebDriver
        
        ```
        python3 -m test.compatibility-suite record
        ```
