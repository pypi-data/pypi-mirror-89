Description: 
        CF Python
        =========
        
        The Python cf package is an Earth science data analysis library that
        is built on a complete implementation of the CF data model

        Functionality
        =============
        
        The `cf` package implements the CF data model
        (https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-4619-2017) for its internal data
        structures and so is able to process any CF-compliant dataset. It is
        not strict about CF-compliance, however, so that partially conformant
        datasets may be ingested from existing datasets and written to new
        datasets. This is so that datasets which are partially conformant may
        nonetheless be modified in memory.
        
        The `cf` package can:
        
        * read field constructs from netCDF, PP and UM datasets,
        
        * create new field constructs in memory,
        
        * write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,
        
        * read, write, and create coordinates defined by geometry cells.
        
        * read netCDF and CDL datasets containing hierarchical groups,
        
        * inspect field constructs,
        
        * test whether two field constructs are the same,
        
        * modify field construct metadata and data,
        
        * create subspaces of field constructs,
        
        * incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files,
        
        * read, write, and create data that have been compressed by convention
          (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays), whilst presenting a view of the
          data in its uncompressed form,
        
        * combine field constructs arithmetically,
        
        * manipulate field construct data by arithmetical and trigonometrical
          operations,
        
        * perform statistical collapses on field constructs,
        
        * perform histogram, percentile and binning operations on field
          constructs,
        
        * regrid field constructs,
        
        * apply convolution filters and moving means to field constructs,
        
        * calculate derivatives of field constructs,
        
        * create field constructs to create derived quantities (such as
          vorticity).
        
        
        Visualization
        =============
        
        Powerful, flexible, and very simple to produce visualizations of field
        constructs are available with the `cfplot` package
        (http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot), that needs to be installed
        seprately to the `cf` package.
        
        See the `cfplot` gallery (http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot/gallery.html)
        for the full range range plotting possibilities with example code.
        
        
        Command line utilities
        ======================
        
        During installation the ``cfa`` command line utility is also
        installed, which
        
        * generates text descriptions of field constructs contained in files,
          and
        
        * creates new datasets aggregated from existing files.
        
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        Tests are run from within the ``cf/test`` directory:
        
            python run_tests.py
