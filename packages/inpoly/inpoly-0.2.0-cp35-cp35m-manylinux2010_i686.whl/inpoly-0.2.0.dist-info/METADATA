## `INPOLY: Fast point(s)-in-polygon queries`

A fast 'point(s)-in-polygon' routine for `Python`.

`INPOLY` returns the "inside/outside" status for a set of vertices `VERT` and a general polygon (`PSLG`) embedded in the two-dimensional plane. General non-convex and multiply-connected polygonal regions can be handled.

`INPOLY` is based on a 'crossing-number' test, counting the number of times a line extending from each point past the right-most region of the polygon intersects with the polygonal boundary. Points with odd counts are 'inside'. A simple implementation requires that each edge intersection be checked for each point, leading to (slow) `O(N*M)` overall complexity.

This implementation seeks to improve these bounds. Query points are sorted by `y-value` and candidate intersection sets are determined via binary-search. Given a configuration with `N` test points, `M` edges and an average point-edge 'overlap' of `H`, the overall complexity scales like `O(M*H + M*LOG(N) + N*LOG(N))`, where `O(N*LOG(N))` operations are required for the initial sorting, `O(M*LOG(N))` operations are required for the set of binary-searches, and `O(M*H)` operations are required for the actual intersection tests. `H` is typically small on average, such that `H << N`. Overall, this leads to fast `O((N+M)*LOG(N))` complexity for average cases.

### `Quickstart`

    Clone/download + unpack this repository.
    python3 setup.py install
    python3 example.py --IDnumber=1
    python3 example.py --IDnumber=2
    python3 example.py --IDnumber=3

### `Demo problems`

The following set of example problems are available in `example.py`: 

    example: 1 # a simple box-type geometry to get started
    example: 2 # random queries using a common geographic dataset
    example: 3 # speed test vs existing inpolygon implementations

Run `python3 example.py --IDnumber=N` to call the `N-th` example.

### `Fast kernels`

`INPOLY` relies on `Cython` to compile the core "inpolygon" tests into a fast kernel. `inpoly_.pyx` contains the human-readable `Cython` implementation, `inpoly_.c` is the auto-generated output. For a full build:

    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
    python3 setup.py install

These steps should "compile" the `Cython` kernel `inpoly_.pyx` into the `Python`-compatible `c`-code `inpoly_.c`, which can then be compiled into the binary lib `inpoly_.so[pyd|dylib]`.
