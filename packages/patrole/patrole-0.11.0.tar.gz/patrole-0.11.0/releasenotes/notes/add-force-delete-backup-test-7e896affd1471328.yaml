    Added an RBAC test for force-deleting a backup which enforces the cinder

    Corrected the policy action in the ``rbac_rule_validation`` decorator
    for the test ``test_snapshot_force_delete`` from
    "volume_extension:volume_admin_actions:force_delete" to
    "volume_extension:snapshot_admin_actions:force_delete".
