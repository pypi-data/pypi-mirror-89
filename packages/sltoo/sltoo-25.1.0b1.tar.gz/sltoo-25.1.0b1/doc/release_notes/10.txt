Add HTML output. It is fully usabale, including all links. It's based
on the new topic based output.  This feature is mostly usable, but
still missing some small features like table of contents.  New man
page describing this feature is available.

Add graph2 output which is a requirement dependency graph based on
topics.

graph ouput only outputs requirements which are referenced by the
topic. Man page is also included.

Add Topic tag to emacs requirement mode.

Add dependency handling for topic handling.

Fixed the Config class: now it is possible to use the same output
module multiple times with different set of parameters.  Note: the new
version is not compatible with the old Config files.  There is the
need to repleace the 'output_specs' dictionary with an appropriate
list. 

Removed old and depricated command line parameters -o / -l / -p: it is
not longer possible to support these because it contradicts the way
the config is build.

Rewrote the INTRODUCTION chapter in rmtoo.7 and adapted the
information to the current implementation. 

Bug#2967323 fixed: status field of example in man page updated.

Bug#3031142 fixed: check for connected component added.

Added empty test classes for new python files.  This decreases the
total test coverage to about 57%.

Reorganized many requirements and adapted their state to reflect
reality.
