   an example)

 * Separate protocol from transport mechanism, to improve the ability to support multiple protocol versions. Note: constructor
   args are changing accordingly.
 * Add initial support for STOMP 1.2
 * Moved username and passcode params out of constructor and into the connect method. The basic connection process is therefore now:

     > conn = stomp.Connection([('localhost', 61613)])
     > conn.start()
     > conn.connect('admin', 'password', wait=True)
