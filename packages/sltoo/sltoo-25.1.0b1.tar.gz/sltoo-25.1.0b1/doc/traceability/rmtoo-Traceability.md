# Introduction

## *rmtoo*

* File-based requirements tracking tool
    * one file for each requirement
    * group requirements by topics
    * document and requirements \LaTeX based
* Convert requirements into PDF document

An
\href{https://github.com/florath/rmtoo/releases/download/v23/rmtooIntroductionV9.pdf}{introduction
presentation} into *rmtoo*  and with more
\href{https://github.com/florath/rmtoo/releases/download/v23/rmtooDetailsV5.pdf}{details}.

## Outline

This slideshow provides an overview over the new features not mentioned in the presentation below.

* Introduction into the traceability features
* Export and import of *xlsx* files
* Show missing features and how to solve them


# Traceability

* Traceability for the given requirements 
* Bring code and documentation into same repository
* Integrate into build-system
  * Detect upstream changes to requirements
  * Quickly identify affected code-regions
* No silver bullet for verification 

## Scenario

The idea for this solution emerged when a requirements document with its
traceability matrix was finalised. Then the inevitable happened: a change
request.

* Requirements have changed, and
* some other code has to be changed as well.

## Requirements (I)

The following problems have been solved using *sltoo*

* Keep requirements and code synced
* Update test specification and keep tests synced
  * Detect upstream changes to requirements
  * Quickly identify affected code-regions
* Traceability matrix must be correct at any given time

## Requirements (II)

* Code and requirements belong together
    * Same repository
	* CI runs unit-tests
	* CI creates traceability matrix automatically
* Unit-tests point to test specification
    * Changes to tests must be reflected in test specification
	* Manual work
	* No silver bullet
	* *Backwards* arrow in V-model
* Changes to test specification must fail CI toolchain
    * For unchanged unit-tests
    * Link not obvious from specification
	* CI tool must validate
	* *Forwards* arrow in V-model

# sltoo Traceability

## Introduction

* V-Model as reference
* Directions for Traceability
    * Forwards (black)
    * Backward (green)

## Backwards --- Unit-tests

Every specification-item has a name, e.g., ``SWC-TS-102``, and a unique hash
(more later). Every unit-test lists the specifications it solves.

The following unit-test will test the aforementioned  *software component test specification* item *102*.

```python
def test_adding_req(self, record_property):
    record_property('req', 'SWC-TS-102-96ac8522')
	assert True
```

## Backwards --- Traceability Matrix Input

* Running `pytest` will yield a *xunit* file `result.xml`
* This file is used to generate the traceability matrix
* Any unit testing framework can be used if the XML is equivalent

```xml
<testcase time="0.048" name="rmttest_adding_req" line="89"
 file="rmtoo/tests/RMTTest-Output/RMTTest-Xls.py"
 classname="rmtoo.tests.RMTTest-Output.RMTTest-Xls.RMTTestOutputXls">
  <properties>
    <property name="req" value="SWC-TS-102-96ac8522"/>
  </properties>
</testcase>
```


## Forwards

The previously test requirement ``SWC-TS-102`` will change and with it it's hash-value.

Hence the test on the previous page will fail the traceability matrix because the hash *96ac8522*
has changed.

Time for your engineer to ensure if/what needs to change.

\vfill

```python
def test_adding_req(self, record_property):
    record_property('req', 'SWC-TS-102-96ac8522')
	assert True
```


## Specification Hash

* SHA256 hash calculated over sum of
    * Description,
	* Titel, and
	* Verification Method (if available)
* Rationale is only informative


## Results

The status *external* will yield the following results:

* *open*
    * No matching requirement ID
* *passed*
    * Matching requirement ID
	* All hashes match
	* Unit-tests passed
* *failed*
    * Matching requirement ID
	* Some/all hashes didn't match, or
	* Unit-tests haven't passed


## Example

From the test specification in *rmtoo's* ``testspe`` folder.

## Example (II)

Example project with versioned documents:
\href{https://kown7.github.io/pymergevcd/}{pymergevcd}


## Future Developements

* Write Parser for *Test Reports*
    * Documents with the correct identifier automatically solve the specification
	* Document Formats:
	    * docx (maybe with pandoc)
		* \LaTeX
* Cross-Document References
    * *Solved by external*
	    * *Solved by* is used in *downwards* direction in the V.
	    * Only within document at the moment. Makes merging documents easier.
    * *Depends on external*
	    * References requirements in other documents, can be with or without hashes.
		* Think about extending the current *Depends on* handler (deprecated) for use as external (leftwards, upwards) reference.


# Excel Support

## Rationale

* Good-enough GUI
* Suits love it
* The *Truth* is still in your repository
  * Import from Excel to repository
  * Export every build to a new Excel file
  * Templating for branding


# Final Thoughts

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install sltoo==24.5b5
```

Traceability features are in the beta releases.


## Public Service Announcement

* Never test against your requirements
    * Always write some form of test specification
    * Consider cucumber for acceptance testing
