    Notation:
        - :math:`r_{wse}`: Weighted sum of error reward
        - :math:`w_{i}`: Reward weight of state i
        - :math:`s_{i}`: State value of state i
        - :math:`s^*_{i}`: Reference value of state i
        - :math:`l_{i}`: State length of state i
        - :math:`n_{i}`: Reward power of state i
        - :math:`b`: Bias

    | :math:`l_i = 2` for states with positive and negative values.

    If environments constraints are violated to a certain degree, a special violation reward is returned as follows:

    .. math::
        r_{total} = (1.0 - d_{violation})  r_{wse} + d_{violation} r_{violation}

    Notation:
        - :math:`r_{total}`: Total reward
        - :math:`r_{wse}`: Weighted sum of error reward
        - :math:`r_{violation}`: Constraint violation reward
        - :math:`d_{violation}`: Limit violation degree :math:`d_{violation} \in [0,1]`


    The violation reward can be chosen freely by the user and shall punish the agents to comply with the constraints.
    Per default, the violation reward is selected so that it is always the worst expected reward the agent could get.

    .. math::
        r_{violation} = r_{wse,min} / (1 - \gamma)

    :math:`r_{wse,min}` is the minimal :math:`r_{wse}` (=reward_range[0]) and :math:`\gamma` the agents discount factor.
