Why not IPython via Jupyter?
----------------------------

There will always be a need for simple terminal-like
interaction. Although there is IPython support via Jupyter all of this
is pretty heavy-weight. To code to this a developer needs to code
write a kernel, and use a wire protocol and this adds complexity not
only for the person developing this package, but also for the user who
needs to load the extra layers that aren't used. And when something
goes wrong, it is harder to track down problems.
