Description: # py-mon ![](https://api.ghprofile.me/view?username=TrustedMercury-py-mon)
        Simple package to automatically restart application when file changes are detected!
        
        I spend a lot of time developing discord bots and it's a hassle to constantly ``Ctrl+C`` and then run the bot again on my terminal. As an active web developer who works with NodeJS, I decided to make something like [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) but for Python.
        
        Introducing ``py-mon``, a simple and easy to use python package that automatically runs your python script when it detects file changes. I've only spent a couple of hours in developing this and I hope to add a bunch of features in the future, from ignoring certain files to prioritizing certain extensions.
        
        
        ## Sidetrack - A little about me
        ```
        I'm a 13 year old full-stack web developer and I love working with Python, NodeJS, SQL
        and other cool software! I want to make a positive change with the help of software and
        do some cool stuff as I grow. That's just a little about me, back to the package!
        ```
        
        
        ## Quickstart
        I wanted to make this package as easy as possible to use. Here's a quick start, it's essentially all you'll need.

        ```
        pymon filename.py
        ```
