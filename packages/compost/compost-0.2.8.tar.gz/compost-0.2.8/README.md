# compost
Compost is an energy consumption modelling toolkit for inverse modelling of energy consumption using measured data

The system is in its very early stages and has very limited functionality at present.
It will eventually include a series of simple tools that will fit inverse models to measured data.
These will be usable to conduct common calculations such as energy saving estimates.
