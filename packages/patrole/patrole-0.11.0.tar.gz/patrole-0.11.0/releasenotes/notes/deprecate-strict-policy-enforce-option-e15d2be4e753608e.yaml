deprecations:
  - |
    The configuration option ``[patrole] strict_policy_check`` is deprecated
    and will be removed in the Rocky release cycle.
other:
  - |
    The default value for ``[patrole] strict_policy_check`` has been changed
    to ``True`` because a Patrole test should always fail if the policy action
    is invalid, to avoid false positives.
