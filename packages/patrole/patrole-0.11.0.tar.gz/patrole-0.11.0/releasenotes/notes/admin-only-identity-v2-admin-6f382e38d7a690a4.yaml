fixes:
  - |
    Removed ``rule`` kwarg from ``rbac_rule_validation`` decorator for identity
    v2 admin tests, because the identity v2 admin API does not do policy
    enforcement, and instead checks whether the request object has
    ``context_is_admin``.
other:
  - |
    Updated the class names for identity v2 tests to include the "Admin"
    substring, to convey the fact that these tests are only intended
    to test the v2 admin API, not the v2 API.
