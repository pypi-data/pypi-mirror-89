    This release marks the start of Queens release support in Patrole.
other:
    - OpenStack Releases supported after this release are **Queens**
      and **Pike**.

      The release under current development of this tag is Rocky, meaning
      that every Patrole commit is also tested against master during the Rocky
      cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using Patrole as of
      this tag will work against a Rocky (or future release) cloud.
