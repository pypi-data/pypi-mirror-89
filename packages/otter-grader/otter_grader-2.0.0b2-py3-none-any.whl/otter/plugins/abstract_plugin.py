class PluginEventNotSupportedException(Exception):
    """
    Exception to raise when an event is not supported by a plugin.
    """


class AbstractOtterPlugin(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for Otter plugins to inherit from. Includes the following methods:

    - ``during_generate``: run during Otter Generate while all files are in-memory and before the
      the `tmp` directory is created
    - ``before_grading``: run before the submission is executed
    - ``after_execution``: run after the submission is executed
    - ``after_grading``: run after all tests are run and scores are assigned
    - ``generate_report``: run after results are written

    See the docstring for the default implementation of each method for more information, including
    arguments and return values. If plugin has no actions for any event above, that method should raise
    ``otter.plugins.PluginEventNotSupportedException``. (This is the default behavior of this ABC, so
    inheriting from this class will do this for you for any methods you don't overwrite.)

    If this plugin requires metadata, it should be included in the ``plugin_config`` key of the 
    ``otter_config.json`` file as a subdictionary with key ``PLUGIN_CONFIG_KEY``. **You must set this
    class variable otherwise no metadata will be passed to the plugin.** For example, if 
    ``MyOtterPlugin.PLUGIN_CONFIG_KEY`` is ``my_otter_plugin``, the ``otter_config.json`` should look
    something like:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "plugins": [
                "my_otter_plugin_package.MyOtterPlugin"
