Description: # SALTSTACK Nornir
        
        Work in progress.
        
        Repository to store Nornir based SALTSTACK modules:
        
        - salt-nornir proxy minion module <- done
        - salt-nornir execution module <- done
        - salt-nornir state module <- not completed
        - salt-nornir runner module <- not started
        
        Nornir modules [pull request](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/58393)
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Primary reason for developing Nornir proxy is scaling issues. 
        
        Not a secret that normally for each network device we want to manage with SALT, there is a dedicated proxy-minion process must be forked and configured. Each such a process consumes from 40 to 70 MByte or RAM. Meaning, to managed 1000 network devices, 40-70 Gbyte of RAM required. That is a big amount of resources to spent. Problem aggravated by the fact that SSH based proxy-minions have to run with multiprocessing mode off, resulting in use of threading to run tasks. However, threading prone to memory leaks [issue](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/38990), workaround - periodic processes restart, that in return raises operational costs of overall system.
        
        ## Design
        
        <img src="images/Nornir proxy-minion architecture.png">
        
        [Nornir ](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is an open-source automation software that uses same libraries under the hood as some other Network proxy-minion - NAPALM, Netmiko, Paramiko, NCClient etc. The key differentiator of Nornir is that it uses Python to express task execution work flows and runs them in parallel using threading. 
        
        Wrapping Norninr in a salt-proxy allowing us to use SALT systems such as schedulers, reactors, returners, mines, pillars, API etc. together with Nornir's capability to effectively run jobs for multiple devices. As a result, single proxy process can deliver configuration or retrieve state from multiple devices simultaneously. Moreover, due to Nornir stateless nature, proxy can and should operate with multiprocessing set to True.
        
        To illustrate, say we want to manage same 1000 devices, but with Nornir proxy. For that we start 10 Nornir processes proxying for 100 devices each, say each process consumes 200 MByte of RAM, resulting in 2 GByte of RAM to run 10 process. Every time we want to run task, new process started, consuming another 200 MByte or RAM. Assume extreme case, we have 4 tasks executing for 1000 devices with process dedicated to each task, that would consume 10 GByte of RAM, once tasks completed and processes destroyed, RAM consumption will fall back to 2 GByte. That is, in author's opinion, quite an improvement compared to above example where we used 40-70 GByte or RAM to manage same number of devices.
        
        ## Inter process communication
        
        To facilitate long running connections, proxy-minion architecture adapted to use queues for inter-process jobs communication.
        
        <img src="images/nornir_proxy_inter_process_communication_v0.png">
        
        Above architecture helps avoid these problems:
        - If no long running connections exists to devices, each new task creates dedicated connections to devices, increasing overall execution time
        - Increase in the number of connections increases load on AAA system (Tacacs, Radius) as more tasks result in more authentication requests from devices
        
        ## Drawbacks
        
        - Double targeting required to narrow down tasks execution to a subset of hosts
        - In addition to knowing how pillar works, one will have to know how [Nornir inventory](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/tutorial/inventory.html) structured to use it effectively, as Nornir inventory integrated in proxy-minion pillar
        - Tasks executed sequentially one after another, if a lot of tasks scheduled simultaneously, they will consume resource waiting to execute
