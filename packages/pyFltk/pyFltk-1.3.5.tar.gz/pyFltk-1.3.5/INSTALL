I. General Notes:
-----------------

If your platform comes without OpenGL or Forms support, or you just get
into troubles using the default setup script, it is possible to disable 
Forms and OpenGl support from the pyFltk build. The following command 
line switches are provided for this:

--disable-gl		: will disable OpenGL support
--disable-forms		: will disable Forms support

In general, however, setup.py will take the proper settings from your Fltk 
installation, to be used for the compilation of pyFltk.

II. UNIX:
---------

We've only tested it under Linux (Ubuntu 18) so far.

1.  Unpack the archive into a directory of your choice:
   
     gunzip pyfltkxxxx.tar.gz    
     tar xf pyfltkxxxx.tar 

2.  To build the python wrappers:

    You might need the following additional packages:
    sudo apt-get install python3-distutils
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev
 
     cd pyfltkxxx
     python setup.py build
     python setup.py install   

     This will build the wrapper and install it to the Python directores.

     You should then be able to swith to fltk/test/ and run the demos 
     by typing:  python demos.py

	
Note: This assumes that you properly built and installed fltk. Note that on 64bit Unix systems, fltk must be built using --enabled-shared.
   



III. MS-Windows:
----------------


MS-Visual C++ under Windows Console:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As since Python2.4, Windows compilation has changed to MSVC7.0, 
I do not support this anymore!


MinGW
~~~~~

* Important Note:
* 
* Unfortunately, Python is linked against msvcr71, whereas MinGW links 
* against msvcrt. This will cause a number of memory problems, often 
* crashing the application upon termination. If you can live with this, 
* alas! If not, you have to force MinGW to link against msvcr71. This can 
* be done as follows:
* a) Locate the file "specs", this should be in directory 
*    MinGW\lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2  
* b) Change all occurences of -lmsvcrt to -lmsvcr71
*
* End Important Note

1.  Unpack the archive into a directory of your choice:
   
     gunzip pyfltkxxxx.tar.gz    
     tar xf pyfltkxxxx.tar  

2.  Build the proper libpython24a.lib. See http://pyfltk.sourceforge.net 
    for directions.

3.  Set the environment variable FLTK_HOME to the place where you
    installed FLTK. This is only necessary if you get problems with
    your default installation of fltk or if you want to override 
    the default installation.

4.  To build the python wrappers:
 
     Open a MSYS command window
     cd pyfltkxxx
     python setup.py build -cmingw32 install

     This will build the wrapper and install it to the Python directores.

     You should then be able to switch to test/ and run the demos 
     by typing:  python demos.py



III. Other Platforms:
---------------------

Proceed according to the above outline.
I would be glad about any feedback if you succeeded with building
pyFltk on any other platform.
