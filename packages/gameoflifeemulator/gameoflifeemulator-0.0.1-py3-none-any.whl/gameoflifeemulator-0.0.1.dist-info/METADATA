The Game of life Emulator

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British
mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that
its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration
and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate
a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

Cli Usage:
    python3 -m gameoflife --option1=value --option2=value ...

Code Usage:
    gol = GameOfLife(option1=value, option2=value...)
    gol.start()

Options:
    you can customize the emulator using this options

    `width`         width of the world. default: width of the terminal
    `height`        hegith of the world. default: height of the terminal
    `live_char`     symbol of the live cell. default: `+`
    `dead_char`     symbol of the dead cell. default: ` `
    `sleep_time`    sleep time between world frames(secounds). default: `0.05`
    `border_char`   the world border chars. default: `#`
    `title`         a title of the head of the world. default: `Conway's Game of life`
    `random_har`    how much initialized live cells. every more means harder. default: `3`

Cli Example:
    gameoflife --width=100 --height=40 --live_char='@' --sleep_time=0.2 --title='my gameoflife'

Code Example:
    GameOfLife(width=100, live_char='@' sleep_time=0.2, title="something").start()
