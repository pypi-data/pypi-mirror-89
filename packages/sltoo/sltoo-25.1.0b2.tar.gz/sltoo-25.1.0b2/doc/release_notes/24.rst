IMPORTANT
=========

CONFIGURATION IS UNDERGOING A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING.
THE CURRENT VERSIONS (V22-V24) WILL (ONLY) BE ONE STEP IN THE
DIRECTION THE CONFIGURATION WILL CHANGE TO.
BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE CHANGED, THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC UPDATE
POSSIBLE.
IF YOU HAVE A RUNNING INSTALLED rmtoo THERE IS NO NEED TO UPDATE
DIRECTLY (IF YOU DO NOT NEED ANY OF THE NEW FEATURES).
IF YOU WANT TO USE THE NEW FEATURES, PLEASE FIRST READ THE
DOCUMENTATION (rmtoo-config3(5)).  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS
FEEL FREE TO CONTACT OUR SUPPORT AT rmtoo@florath.net
