Description: # jklib
        
        ## Description
        My personal python library containing my frequently used code snippets I've accumulated over the years
        
        The snippets are split into folders/categories:
        - `db`: Database and object storage management
        - `django`: Web development around **Django** and **Django Rest Framework** 
        - `dtsci`: Data-science, mostly revolving around **Numpy** and **Pandas**
        - `std`: Utility functions often unrelated to 3rd party packages, usually built around the standard library
        - `web`: Web scrapping and web browsing, mostly around **requests**, **selenium**, and the likes
        
        ## Pre-commit hooks
        The project uses `pre-commit` hooks to keep a consistent file structure
        
        As such, if you want to make some changes while using the pre-commit hooks:
        - Install the necessary libraries: `pip install pydocstyle isort black flake8`
        - Use them (through your IDE) to automatically format/check your files
        - Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
        - Setup pre-commit by running `pre-commit install`
