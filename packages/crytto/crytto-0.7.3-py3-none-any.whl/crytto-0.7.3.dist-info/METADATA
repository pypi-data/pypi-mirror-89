filecrypt - OpenSSL file encryption
===================================

  Author    [M. Massenzio](http://codetrips.com)
  --------- --------------------------------------------------------
  Version   0.7.2
  Updated   2020-04-30
  Code      [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/marco/filecrypt)

overview
========

Uses OpenSSL library to encrypt a file using a private/public key pair
and a one-time secret.

A full description of the process can be found
[here](https://github.com/massenz/HOW-TOs/blob/master/HOW-TO%20Encrypt%20archive.rst).

See also this [blog
entry](https://codetrips.com/2016/07/13/filecrypt-openssl-file-encryption/)
for more details.

installation
============

Install directly from PyPi:

    pip install crytto

Please note the **package name** (`filecrypt` was conflicting with the
existing `FileCrypt` package name, and `crypto` was already taken).

This requires OpenSSL to be installed on your machine:

    sudo apt-get install openssl

Alternatively, clone the project from github and follow the instructions
below:

    git clone git@bitbucket.org:marco/filecrypt.git

Once cloned, you can try out functionality by packaging it as a
self-contained executable: use the `package.sh` script to generate a
`filecrypt.pyz` self-extracting executable in the `dist/` folder and
then you can encrypt/decrpyt files (see the
[configuration](#configuration) section first).

\`\`\`shell script \# To encrypt ./filecrypt.pyz -o test.enc
/path/to/my\_plaintext.txt

To decrypt:
===========

./filecrypt.pyz -d -o /path/to/whatever.txt test.enc \`\`\`

Once all dependencies are installed:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

tests can be run via:

    ./run_tests.sh

See both the `run_tests` and `package` scripts for examples of how to
use encryption/decryption.

configuration
=============

This uses a YAML file to describe the configuration; by default it
assumes it is in `/etc/filecrypt/conf.yml` but its location can be
specified using the `-f` flag.

The structure of the `conf.yml` file is as follows:

``` {.yaml}
keys:
     private: sample.pem
     public: sample.pub
     secrets: .

store: keys.csv

##
# Any option below is optional and can be omitted.
#
# Where to store the encrypted file; the folder MUST already exist and the user
# have write permissions.  Defaults to the current directory; can be overridden
# using --out on the command line.
#
#out: /data/store/file

# Whether to securely delete the original plaintext file; by default it is kept.
# It can be overridden by using `--keep` when running `filecrypt`.  True by default.
shred: true

# Optional logging configuration - mostly useful to
# diagnose issues.  Default is WARN level.
logging:
   format: "%(asctime)s [%(levelname)-5s] %(message)s"
   level: WARN
```

The `private`/`public` keys are a key-pair generated using the
`openssl genrsa` command; the encryption key used to actually encrypt
the file will be created in the `secrets` folder, and afterward
encrypted using the `public` key and stored in the location provided.

The name will be `pass-key-nnnn.enc`, where `nnnn` will be a random
value between `1000` and `9999`, that has not been already used for a
file in that folder.

The name of the secret passphrase can also be defined by the user, using
the `--secret` option (it will be left unmodified):

-   if it does not exist a random secure one will be created, used for
    encryption, then encrypted and saved with the given path, while the
    plain-text temporary version securely destroyed; OR

-   if it is the name of an already existing file, it will be decrypted,
    used to encrypt the file, then left **unchanged** on disk.

**NOTE** we recommend NOT to re-use encryption passphrases, but always
generate a new secret.

**NOTE** it is currently not possible to specify a plain-text
passphrase: we always assume that the given file has been encrypted
using the `private` key.

The `store` file is a CSV list of:

    "Original archive","Encryption key","Encrypted archive"
    201511_data.tar.gz,/opt/store/pass-key-001.enc,201511_data.tar.gz.enc

a new line will be appended at the end; any comments will be left
unchanged.

usage
-----

### keypair generation

We do not provide the means to generate them (this will be done at a
later stage), but for now they can be generated using:

    openssl genrsa -out ./key.pem 2048
    openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pub -outform PEM -pubout

their path can then be specified in the `conf.yaml` file.

### encryption

Always use the `--help` option to see the most up-to-date options
available; anyway, the basic usage is:

    filecrypt my_secret.txt

which will create a `my_secret.txt.enc` file in the current directory,
unless a different one has been specified using the `out` option in
`/etc/filecrypt/conf.yml`.

A completely random and cryptographically secure key will have been
created; used; and then encrypted to the `secrets` location, its full
path stored in the CSV keystore named in the `store` option of the YAML
configuration file.

Finally, the plaintext version of this key will have been safely
destroyed.

A more elaborate one (see the example configuration in
`examples/example_conf.yaml`):

    filecrypt --conf example_conf.yaml -s secret-key.enc plaintext.txt

will create an encrypted copy of the file to be stored as
`/data/store/plaintext.txt.enc`; the original file **will not** be
securely destroyed (using `shred`); and the encryption key name and
location (the current directory, and `secret-key.enc`) to be stored in
the `keys.csv` file:

``` {.yaml}
# Fragment of example_conf.yaml
...
store: keys.csv
out: /data/store
shred: false
```

**Specifying the encryption destination**

By default, the encrypted filename has the same name as the plaintext
file, with the `.enc` extension appended; and it is saved to either the
current directory or the `out` location specified in the configuration
YAML.

By using the `--out` (`-o`) option, it is possible to specify the
location of the output encrypted file, either absolute, or relative to
the current directory:

    filecrypt -o mysecret.ser my_secret.doc

or:

    filecrypt -o secret/files/mysecret.ser my_secret.doc

Regardless of the means of specifying the input/outpup files, the full
path to both files will **always** be used in the CSV keystore,
regardless of whether a relative or absolute path was specified on the
command line.

**IMPORTANT** \>We recommend testing your configuration and command-line
options on test files: `shred` erases files in a *terminal* way that is
**not** recoverable: if you mess up, **you will lose data**. \> \>You
have been warned.

### decryption

To decrypt a file that has been encrypted using this utility, use the
`-d` flag:

    decrypt -o example_conf.yaml -d plaintext.txt

If the encryption key (`--secret` or `-s`) is not specified, then the
application will try and locate the plaintext file in the keystore
specified in the `conf.yaml` using the `store` key:

``` {.yaml}
store: keys.csv
...
```

and derive the location of the encryption key from the entry, if one is
found.

Please note that **only the filename is used to lookup the key** and so
two **encrypted** filenames in different directories but with the same
name will be assumed to have been encrypted with the same `passphrase`.

The `passphrase` file, is stored with its full path: if you move the
keys, or rename any of the folder in their path, you will have to update
the `keystore` (or use the `-s` flag when decrypting).

As with encryption, the `--out` flag can be used to specify the output
file; otherwise, the current directory will be used.

The encrypted file will be left untouched: the `--keep` flag *may* be
used, but will have no effect and the value of the `shred:` option will
be ignored.

As the encrypted file is already cryptographically secure a simple
`rm my_secret.doc.enc` will be sufficient to guarantee privacy.

### sharing files

As of `0.5.x`, `crytto` supports encrypting a file using solely a Public
Key, and then the resulting ecnrypted file can be securely decrypted by
the owner of the Secret Key.

The main use case is to enable Alice to send Bob an encrypted file, once
Bob has given her a copy of his Public key; call the latter `bob.pub`
and the file to share `my_secret.txt`, then Alice can execute:

    filecrypt --send --key bob.pub --out my-secret.ser my_secret.txt

after encryption, in the current directory there will be the following
two new files:

    my-secret.ser
    pass-key-000854.enc

the former is the encrypted contents of `my_secret.txt` and the latter
the encrypted passphrase (leaving out the `--out` argument would have
made the encrypted file's name `my_secret.txt.enc`).

Those files can be both sent to Bob or, even better, provided to him
separately for added security; either way, upon receiving them, Bob can
run the following (we assume the `bob.pub` was the private half of the
configured key pair that he keeps in his [configuration
file](#configuration)):

    filecrypt -s pass-key-000854.enc --out alice_secret.txt -d my-secret.ser

(again, leaving out the `--out` is useful when using the defaults, as
the `my_secret.txt.enc` would have turned back into `my_secret.txt` --
in this case, the plaintext decrypted file would have been called
`my-secret.ser.out`).
