'''
Setup.py script (uses setuptools) for building, testing, and installing pyvolve.

To build and install the package as root (globally), enter (from this directory!) - 
    sudo python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py test   # OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED. Please contact author with any failed tests! Note that every once in a while the tests for functions which must generate random numbers take excessively long, so just ctrl-C these and run tests again.
    sudo python setup.py install
    

To install for a particular user (locally), enter - 
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py test   # OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED. Please contact author with any failed tests! Note that every once in a while the tests for functions which must generate random numbers take excessively long, so just ctrl-C these and run tests again.
    python setup.py build --user # where user is the computer account to install pyolve in
