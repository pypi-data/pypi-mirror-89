        ### Introduction
        It only contains one function which accept a dataframe 
        with missing values and replace the NaNs with mean value 
        of the value around these NaNs. The imputation is linear, e.g.
        [nan,nan,5,8] => [-1,2,5,8], [3,nan,nan,9] => [3,5,7,9],
        [1,5,nan,nan] => [1,5,9,13]
        
        Currently only DataFrame is accepted, I may consider to support 
        any arrry-like object in the future.
        
        
        ### Tips
        1. This is actually a package for practice packaging in python. So there may be problems
        with the algorithm and the algorithm may not be efficient.
        2. There should be at least 2 non-nan value in the input, otherwise the original 
        DataFrame will be returned.
        3. Only float point number is tested, so be careful if use this function with other
        value types
