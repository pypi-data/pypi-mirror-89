Description: # comment
        
        The `comment` Python library provides an explicit object for comments.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip install comment-object
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can use `Comment` as a context. It does nothing but expell all comments
        from your source code!
        
        ```
        from comment import Comment
        
        with Comment("seconds") as c:
            DAY = 60 * 60 * 24
        ```
        
        ## Philosophy
        
        A comment should have its scope inside some other code scope.
        
        For example,
        
        ```
        DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 # seconds
        ```
        
        The comment "# seconds" explains `DAY` constant that it has the unit second.
        The scope of this comment is this one line, inside module scope maybe.
        
        A comment can be replaced with an object which does not have any effects on
        the code around.
        
        If a comment breaks the principle, then it is not a comment.
        The coding comment, for example, can be such a type; it should be called a pragma.
