Implementation of the mathematics behind JARUS WG-6 SORA Annex F.

This package was created to support the mathematical models used to derived the iGRC tables and supporting material found in JARUS WG-6 SORA Annex F. It implements the models for computing critical areas, effect of obstacles, ballistic descent, effect of explosions and deflagration that are being used in Annex F. It also includes easy access to the specific choice of parameters that are used in Annex F.

There are a number of examples of how to use this package that operators and others can use as a starting point for doing their own computations as an alternative to using the iGRC table and supporting tables in Annex F and in the SORA.

Finally, this packages can be used for easily recreating some of the figures found in Annex F (see example 8).

The mathematical models implemented in the package are the results of the combined effort of the Quantitative Methods subgroup under Working Group 6.
