.. management_command:: run

Execute a standalone Python script after having set up the Django
environment.

``manage.py run myscript.py`` is almost the same as redirecting stdin
of Django's ``shell`` command (i.e. doing ``manage.py shell <
myscript.py``), but with the possibility of using **command line
arguments**.

For example if you have a file `myscript.py` with the following content...

::

  import sys
  from myapp.models import Partner
  print Partner.objects.get(pk=sys.args[1])

... then you can run this script using::

    $ python manage.py run myscript.py 101
    BÃ¤ckerei Ausdemwald

This command modifies `sys.args`, `__file__` and `__name__` so that
the invoked script sees them as if it had been called directly.

It is similar to the `runscript
<http://django-extensions.readthedocs.org/en/latest/runscript.html>`_
command which comes with `django-extensions
<http://django-extensions.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__.

This is yet another answer to the frequently asked Django question
about how to run standalone Django scripts
(`[1] <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4847469/use-django-from-python-manage-py-shell-to-python-script>`__,
`[2] <http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/sep/22/standalone-django-scripts/>`__).
