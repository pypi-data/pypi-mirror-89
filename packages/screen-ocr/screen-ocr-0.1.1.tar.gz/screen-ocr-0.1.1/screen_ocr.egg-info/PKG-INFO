Description: # Screen OCR
        
        The `screen-ocr` package makes it easy to perform OCR on portions of the screen.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Choose one of the following backends and follow the steps. WinRT is recommended for Windows and Tesseract for all other platforms.
        
        ### WinRT
        
        WinRT is a Windows-only backend that is very fast and reasonably accurate. It requires Python 3.7 or later. To install screen-ocr with WinRT support, run `pip install screen-ocr[winrt]`
        
        ### Tesseract
        
        Tesseract is a cross-platform backend that is much slower and slightly less accurate than WinRT. To install screen-ocr with Tesseract support:
        
        1. Install Tesseract binaries. For Windows, see
        https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki.
        2. pip install screen-ocr[tesseract]
        
        ### EasyOCR
        
        EasyOCR is a very accurate but slow backend and only runs on Python 64-bit, and hence is considered experimental. To install screen-ocr with WinRT support, run `pip install screen-ocr[easyocr]`
        
        ## Usage
        
        See https://github.com/wolfmanstout/gaze-ocr for sample usage.
        
        If using Tesseract with a custom installation directory on Windows, set
        `tesseract_data_path` and `tesseract_command` paths appropriately when
        constructing a `Reader` instance.
