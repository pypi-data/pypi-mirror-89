Description: # Auto Tracer
        
        Automatic tracing of Python code.
        
        ## Purpose
        
        We developed this module for educational purposes. The output of this module is
        used to verify code tracings performed by students who are learning to code.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use this program, run:
        
        `python auto_tracer.py FILENAME.py`
        
        Where `FILENAME.py` is the name of the Python file that you wish be checked.
        
        ## Disclaimer
        
        This module is in VERY early stage and I don't know how it behaves with larger
        pieces of software.
