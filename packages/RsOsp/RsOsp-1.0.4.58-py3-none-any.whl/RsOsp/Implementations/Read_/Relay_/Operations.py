		Queries the internal switching counter, which acquires the total number of operation cycles of each relay (and even of
		I/O channels) . The number of cycles is stored durable in the flash EEPROM of the module that the relay is part of.
		Storing occurs after every hour of R&S OSP operation, but only if the number has changed. Besides this time-controlled
		storing, also the query command triggers storing the counter's value. To make sure not to lose any operation cycle counts,
		we recommend sending the command method RsOsp.Read.Relay.Operations.get_ before terminating a remote control session. If
		the module that you specify does not have a switching counter, the query always returns the value '0' as the result.
			INTRO_CMD_HELP: For example, the following solid-state relay (SSR) modules and digital I/O modules have no switching counter: \n
			- R&S OSP-B103
			- R&S OSP-B107
			- R&S OSP-B127
			- R&S OSP-B128
			- R&S OSP-B142
		In the R&S OSP-B104 and R&S OSP-B114, only the electromechanical relay has a switching counter. \n
			:param channel_list: Specifies the relays and I/O channels to be read. For the channel list syntax, refer to method RsOsp.Route.Close.set.
