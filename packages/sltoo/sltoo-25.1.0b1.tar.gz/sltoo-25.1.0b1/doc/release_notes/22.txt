User visible changes
--------------------

Input files can be stored in multiple different directories.
Input files can be stored in sub-directories. (Input files include
requirements, topics and constraints.)

Drop concept of one master requirement.  This concept maked it
impossible to include complete projects into other projects: in this
case there would be more than one master requirement.

Added (optional) logging of current actions / events.  This makes it
much easier for the user and our support to find problems.

Added cache for reading objects from version control system.  This
speeds up reading (especially projects with a long history)
dramatically.

Fixed priority computation for graph2.

Adapted the configuration to the new object structure.
NOTE: configuration prior to this version of rmtoo can not be used any
more and must be rewritten.  There is a tools with supports you, but
because of the restructuring it is not possible to do the whole
process automatically.

Fixed some problems with historic version handling directly from
version control system. 

Fixed test cases: now they pass on servers in different timezones
(Thanks to vakaras).


Internal Changes
----------------

Complete restructuring of objects - dropping old relicts of the 
pre-topic phase.
(now: TopicContinuumSet -> TopicContinuum -> TopicSet
      -> Topic -> RequirementSet -> Requirement)
This includes a complete rewrite of most parts of the source.

Updated gitpython library from 0.3.0-beta2 to 0.3.2.RC1.

Completely rewritten the interface to the version control system.
From point of the interface there is no difference between files
stored in the file system or in (some) version control system
anymore.  This also makes it much easier adapt rmtoo to other version
control systems like cvs.

Cleaned up source code to implement the Python code style.
