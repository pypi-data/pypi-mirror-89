Without knowing the \u00abtruth\u00bb of the mysterious next generation MMO, \u00abSword Art Online\u00bb (SAO), approximately ten thousand users logged in together, opening the curtains to this cruel death battle.

And in the game world, a gigantic floating castle named \u00abAincrad\u00bb, he distinguished himself as a solo player.Aiming to clear the game by reaching the highest floor, Kirito riskily continued alone. Because of a pushy invitation from a female warrior and rapier expert, Asuna, he teamed up with her. That encounter brought about an opportunity to call out to the fated Kirito.",
