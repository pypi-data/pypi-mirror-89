PyNN 0.9.4 release notes
========================

March 22nd 2019

Welcome to PyNN 0.9.4!


SONATA
-------

SONATA_ is a data format for representing/storing data-driven spiking neuronal network models, experimental protocols
(injecting spikes, currents) and simulation outputs.

In the network representation, all connections are represented explicity, as in PyNNâ€™s
:class:`FromFileConnector` and :class:`FromListConnector`.

A PyNN model/simulation script can be exported in SONATA format,
and a SONATA model/simulation can be read and executed through PyNN
provided the cell types used in the model are compatible with PyNN,
i.e. they must be point neurons.

For more information on working with the SONATA format, see :ref:`sec-sonata`.


Bug fixes and performance improvements
--------------------------------------

A `small number of bugs`_ have been fixed, and the documentation clarified in a few places.
