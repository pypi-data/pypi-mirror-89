other:
    - OpenStack Releases supported after this release are **Pike**.

      The release under current development of this tag is Queens, meaning
      that every Patrole commit is also tested against master during the Queens
      cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using Patrole as of
      this tag will work against a Queens (or future release) cloud.
