Description: 
        
        Thespian is a Python library providing a framework for developing
        concurrent, distributed, fault tolerant applications.
        
        Thespian is built on the Actor Model which allows applications to be
        written as a group of independently executing but cooperating
        "Actors" which communicate via messages.  These Actors run within
        the Actor System provided by the Thespian library.
        
              * Concurrent
              * Distributed
              * Fault Tolerant
              * Scalable
              * Location independent
        
        Actor programming is broadly applicable and it is ideally suited
        for Cloud-based applications as well, where compute nodes are
        added and removed from the environment dynamically.
