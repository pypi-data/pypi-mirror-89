prelude: |
    This release is to tag the Patrole for OpenStack Train release.
    This release marks the start of Train release support in Patrole.
    After this release, Patrole will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Train
    * Stein
    * Rocky
    * Queens

    Current development of Patrole is for OpenStack Ussuri development
    cycle. Every Patrole commit is also tested against master during
    the Ussuri cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Patrole as of this tag will work against a Ussuri (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Train release.
