An ArXiV scraper to retrieve abstracts from given categories and date range.

## Install

Use `pip` (or `pip3` for python3):

```bash
$ pip install arxivabscraper
```

or download the source and use `setup.py`:

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

or if you do not want to install the module, copy `arxivabscraper.py` into your working
directory.

To update the module using `pip`:
```bash
pip install arxivabscraper --upgrade
```

## Examples


You can directly use `arxivabscraper` in your scripts. Let's import `arxivabscraper`
and create a scraper to fetch all preprints in condensed matter physics category
from 2 May 2018 until 2 June 2020 (for other categories, see below):

```python
import arxivabscraper
scraper = arxivabscraper.Scraper(category='physics:cond-mat', date_from='2018-05-02',date_until='2020-06-02')
```
Once we built an instance of the scraper, we can start the scraping:

```python
output = scraper.scrape()
```
While scraper is running, it prints its status:

```
fetching up to  1000 records...
fetching up to  2000 records...
Got 503. Retrying after 30 seconds.
fetching up to  3000 records...
fetching is complete.
```

Finally you can save the output in your favorite format or readily convert it into a pandas dataframe:
```python
import pandas as pd
cols = ('categories', 'abstract')
df = pd.DataFrame(output,columns=cols)
```
