statechart:
  name: Deep history
  description: |
    A statechart that makes use of a deep history state.
    It represents two concurrent processes that iterate over three states (si1, si2, si3 for i in 1..2) on `next`i event.
    The process can be interrupted with a `pause` event.
    When paused, the processes can either be continued (`continue` event) or stopped (`stop` event).
  root state:
    name: root
    initial: active
    states:
      - name: active

          - target: pause
