Active ATM phosphorylates another ATM molecule, and phosphorylated ATM is active.
Active ATM activates p53.
p53 is transcribed and active p53 transcribes MDM2.
MDM2 is degraded.
Active p53 activates Wip1.
Active Wip1 inactivates p53.
Active Wip1 dephosphorylates ATM.
MDM2 ubiquitinates p53 and ubiquitinated p53 is degraded.
HIPK2 inactivates Wip1.
