## Installation

Install via `pip install epispot` <br>
As a shorthand, use as `import epispot as epi`

Using Anaconda? Don't worry, it'll soon be avaliable in anaconda!

## Getting Started

Check the guides and tutorials found
in the `tests/tutorials` folder. All tutorials will have a `.md` file
followed by a corresponding code file. If you get stuck, don't understand 
something, or just need to reference the documentation, per-class 
documentation can be found in the `docs/epispot` folder. You may also find 
it helpful to see the examples in the `tests/examples` folder.

Documentation can easily be accessed from function, class, and file docstrings.
Doc strings provide additional documentation on a certain function.
They can be accessed by the built-in Python `help()` command.
These strings are formatted in Github-flavored markdown.
Additionally, all files will have a 'STRUCTURE' label.
