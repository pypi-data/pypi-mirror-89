Description: 
        Deep-NER
        ============
        
        Named entity recognizer based on ELMo or BERT as feature extractor and
        CRF as final classifier.
        
        The goal of this project is creation of a simple Python package with
        the sklearn-like interface for solution of different named entity 
        recognition tasks in case number of labeled texts is very small (not 
        greater than several thousands). Special neural network language models 
        named as ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) and BERT (Bidirectional
        Encoder Representations from Transformers) ensure this possibility,
        because these language model were pre-trained on large text corpora and
        so they can select deep semantic features from text.
