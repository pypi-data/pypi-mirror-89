Adam Goldman <adam@rtg.com>:
Changes from Adam:
The overload.pl from pyFLTK_20000309_140830 seems to generate code that 
does the wrong thing when given an empty (but defined) string. Attached 
is a replacement. I don't really understand how the whole overloading 
thing is supposed to work but this seems to be an improvement.
