        "description": "Information about replication sessions.  <br/>  <br/>  Replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either  locally or to a remote network device.  Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source data  and periodically updates the copy, keeping it consistent with the source  data. Replication provides an enhanced level of redundancy in case  the main storage backup system fails. As a result, the:  <ul>  <li>Downtime associated cost of a system failure is minimized.  <li>Recovery process from a natural or human-caused disaster is facilitated.  </ul>  A replication session establishes an end-to-end path for a replication   operation between a source and a destination. The replication source and   destination may be local or remote. The session establishes the path that  the data follows as it moves from source to destination.",
