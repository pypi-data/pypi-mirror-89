Description: # Opal Art
        
        Gathers beautiful art. Perhaps as beautiful as [Opal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal).
        
        ## Installing
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install opalart
        ```
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        ```python
        import opalart
        client = opalart.yandere()
        images = await client.getposts(['thighhighs'])
        # Do stuff with the images
        ```
        
        Or grab a single image.  
        This makes the same call as the above, but returns a single random image from the results.
        
        ```python
        import opalart
        client = opalart.yandere()
        image = await client.randpost(['thighhighs'])
        # Do stuff with the image
        ```
