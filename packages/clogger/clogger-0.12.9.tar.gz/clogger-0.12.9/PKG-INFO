        Python logger configuration, my way.
        
        clogger is a library that helps you to configure
        python logging library in the way I like. It
        helps configuration tasks such:
        
        - multiple handlers
        - log level setting
        
        
        clogger contains two classes -
        CustomLogger and CustomFormatter -
        based on default logging library.
        
        CustomFormatter inherit and modify
        logging.Formatter class in order to split
        handler names at the last '.', to improve readability
        of the log.
        
        CustomoLogger class can be used to initialize
        and configure logging
        library in a smart and easily replicable way.
        It also enable a (small) set of preconfigured
        actions.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install clogger is as easy as run ```pip install clogger```.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can configure log inside your script with
        few code rows. 
        
        ```python
        from clogger import CustomLogger
        from datetime import datetime
        
        now = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')
        thisrunlog = 'thisrunlog_{}.log'.format(now)
        
        logger = CustomLogger(
            handler_name="mylog",
            stream_handler=True,
            file_handler=True,
            filenames=["default.log", thisrunlog],
            level="INFO",
        )
        ```
        
        In the above example three handlers
        are defined: one stream handler and two file
        handlers. After definition, the same logger
        can be modified, to hack log level of all
        handlers (of course, the handler must exists
        in the namespace to be varied):
        
        ```python
        # changing log level for all the handlers
        logger.change_level('DEBUG')
        
        # changine level for some handlers
        logger.change_level('DEBUG', ["mylog", "requests"])
        ```
        
        Two methods are definied to be immediately call
        at the start and at the end of a script:
        
        ```python
        logger.starting_message()
        
        #... a lot of code...
        
        logger.exiting_message()
        ```
