def linkage(D, G=None, L='complete', p=1, K=1.0e-12):
    '''
    Performs order preserving hierarchical clustering.
    
    D - Condensed dissimilarity measure. That is, for a set of N elements,
        D is a 1-dimensional array of N(N-1)/2 elements, corresponding to the
        upper half of the dissimilarity matrix laid out row-wise.
    G - Order relation given as a jagged 2D-array as follows:
        if A = G[i] is the i-th array in G, then, for each k in A this is 
        interpreted as i<k in the strict partial order. Default is None,
        meaning that the hierarchical clustering will be performed without
        regard to any order relation.
    L - Linkage function. One of 'single', 'complete' or 'average'.
        Default is 'complete'.
    p - Order of norm. A number greater or equal to 1. Defaults to 1.
    K - The epsilon of the ultrametric completion. Defaults to 1.0e-12.

    The method returns a list of ophac.dtypes.AgglomerativeClusering (AC) objects, 
    each object has two members: "dists" and "joins". The joins hold the order 
    of merges of the clustering, the the dists are the distances for the 
    different joins.

    The AC objects can be passed on as follows to obtain relevant information.
    In the following, ac is an AC object, N is the number of elements in the base set
    and K is the ultrametric completion distance (epsilon). Unless you have used
    a non-default value of K, this may be omitted.

    * To create the corresponding ultrametric:
    import ophaq.ultrametric as ult
    U = ult.ultrametric(ac, N, K)

    * To obtain the k-th partition
    import ophaq.dtypes as dt
    kthPartition = dt.merge(dt.Partition(n=N), ac.joins[:k])

    * To obtain the k-th induced order relation
    import ophac.dtypes as dt
    kthInducedOrder = dt.merge(dt.Quivers(G), ac.joins[:k])

    * To plot the corresponding (partial) dendrogram
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import ophaq.dendrogram  as dend
    fix,ax = plt.subplots(1,1)
    dend.plot(ac, N, ax=ax)
    plt.show()

    The  dend.plot(...) method uses scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram for 
    the plotting, and passes any additional arguments on to that method.

    '''
    Produces an order preserving hierarchical clustering of (M,Q) using parallel 
    processing with a number of processes and a number of samples to generate.

    The algorithm applies a level of noise to the dissimilarity measure to ensure 
    there are no initial tied connections, causing each run to be a polynomial 
    time algorithm for all linkage models. The clusterings are run in parallel, 
    and the returned resulst is the set of optimal clusterings.

    For each optimal (noise perturbated) solution, a de-noised version is produced
    by re-playing the joins on the original dissimilarity measure.
    
    n      - The number of samples to run.
    procs  - Number of processes to run in parallel. Defaults to 4.
    mode   - The approximation mode to use.
             untied  - add noise to the dissimilarity and run un-tied
             rndpick - resolve ties by picking a random pair
             Default is rndpick.

    For the other parameters, se "linkage".

    Returns a list of AC objects, one for each equivalently optimal solution.
    In general, it is expeted that there is only one optimal solution, due to
    the noise added to the dissimilarities, but then again...
