This SDK intends to provide building blocks for Python developers to interact with the NEO blockchain as a means to lower the entry barrier.

It is a work in progress and thus you can expect that not all parts of the blockchain are supported. What is present should be functioning correctly unless explicitely mentioned (e.g. because they depend on structures not yet available).

Please report any issues on `Github <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-mamba/issues>`_ or submit ideas how to improve the SDK.

Also check out our Python smart contract compiler `Boa <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo3-boa>`_ !

Quick install
-------------
::

   pip install wheel neo-mamba

or

::

  git clone https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-mamba.git
  cd neo-mamba
  pip install wheel -e .

Ensure you have PIP >= 19.3

::

   pip install --upgrade "pip>=19.3"

Roadmap
-------
Over time the following components are expected to be implemented starting with the items in "SDK Core". As we
release versions and receive feedback components may be added or restructured. Some components may end up living in
separate repositories but be included here by default (e.g. virtual machine implementations).

- Core (v0.1)
- Network (v0.1)
- Storage (v0.1)
- Virtual Machine
- Smart contracts (v0.4)

Up next: Preview 4 parity

Performance
-----------
`neo-mamba` syncs the network over 2 times faster than the official client `neo-cli <https://github.com/neo-project/neo-node>`_.

Performance was measured by letting each client sync the Preview 3 TestNet from an offline file up to block height 562379.
Syncing was done without verifying the block witnesses (``--noverify`` flag in ``neo-cli``). Each client used LevelDB as
storage backend, with no other additional plugins running. Each client was synced separately with no additional resource
usage on the system. The test was performed on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 (as DOTNET's ECC on OSX is very slow) on a i5-4670K with
16 GB ram.

FAQ
---
1. ``make docs`` fails with ``no theme named 'neo3' found (missing theme.conf?)``. -> ``python setup.py install``.
Try again.
