Added Install.txt to tar package.

Internal Changes
----------------

Text input / output classes were completely rewritten and replace the
old parser. The new classes can be used for writing text files. This
makes it possible that text files can be read in (requirements and
topcs), can be changed programmatically and can then be written back
to the file system. 

Added more automatic regression tests.
