Description: # doctestprinter
        
        **doctestprinter** contains convenience functions to print outputs more adequate
        for doctests.

        Example features:
        
        - removes trailing whitespaces: pandas.DataFrame generates trailing whitespaces,
          which interferes with auto text 'trailing whitespace' removal features,
          leading to failed tests.
        - maximum line width: break long sequences at whitespaces to a paragraph.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installing the latest release using pip is recommended.
        
        ```` shell script
            $ pip install doctestprinter
        ````
        
        The latest development state can be obtained from gitlab using pip.
        
        ```` shell script
            $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/david.scheliga/doctestprinter.git@dev
        ````
        
        
        ## Basic Usage
        
        The default method is `doctestprinter.doctest_print`.
        
        ```` python
        
            >>> from doctestprinter import doctest_print
            >>> sample_object = list(range(80))
            >>> doctest_print(sample_object, max_line_width=70)
