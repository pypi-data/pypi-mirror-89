features:
  - |
    We have replaced CONF.patrole.rbac_test_role with
    CONF.patrole.rbac_test_roles, where instead of single role we can specify
    list of roles to be assigned to test user. This way we may run rbac tests
    for scenarios that requires user to have more that a single role.
deprecations:
  - |
    Config parameter CONF.rbac_test_role is deprecated in favor of
    CONF.rbac_test_roles that implements a list of roles instead of single role.
