TODO
* rename libvshadow_volume_get_store to libvshadow_volume_get_store_by_index
* fix issue with multi threaded read test
  - store descriptor initialization?
* add error tolerance for missing NTFS backup volume header
* remove hard coded 0x4000 block size
  - use or pass io handle block size instead
* add tests
  - create test image
  - create test plan
  - test and add ignore overlay when reading from next store
* multi-threading support
  - what about abort value?
* beta
  - fix open issues
* add libfdata and libfcache for caching ?

API:
* allow access to block list
  - finish and expose libvshadow_store_get_block()
  - split block list and run-time btree
* get operating machine string
* get service machine string
* get size
* is open
* finish store close function

Error tollerance:
* add support for catalog entry 3 defined before 2

Format:
* how are multiple copies per set stored?
* the store file can be fragmented
  - block range list defines the fragments ?
* what about trailing volume data that windows is hiding 0x1000 bytes in size ?
  also seen in BDE, so likely something of NTFS

Tools:
* vshadowinfo
  - print attribute flags description
* vshadowmount
  - dokan fix volume size hints
