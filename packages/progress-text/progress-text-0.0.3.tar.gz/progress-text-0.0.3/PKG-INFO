Description: # progress-text
        
        Python package for printing progress in text.
        
        ## Important Note
        
        **The `every_percent` in this tool can be achieved by setting the parameter `mininterval` to be equal to `num_max_iters * every_percent / 100`. The reason why I created this tool was that I did not read the documents of `tqdm` carefully (I have read it now on 2020-12-18) and I wanted a feature like `every_percent`.**
        
        Now that this tool seems to be not so useful, however, I will not delete this project. Instead, I may keep improving this tool and regard it as a practice.
        
        ## Why not [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
        
        [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is awesome, but I just want to print the progress to a log file by `nohup`.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```shell
        pip3 install --upgrade progress-text
        ```
        
        Or clone the project, go into the project directory, and execute
        
        ```shell
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```shell
        pip install ./
        ```
        
        Or simply copy the source code.
        
        ## Usage
        
        See [`example.py`](./example.py).
