Description: # NRGTEN
        Najmanovich Research Group Toolkit for Elastic Networks
        
        NRGTEN is not yet uploaded to PyPi (it will be in the coming week). If you wish to install it as a package before that, simply clone this repository:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/gregorparof/nrgten_package
        ```
        
        Then change to the package directory:
        
        ```
        cd nrgten_package
        ```
        
        And type the following command:
        
        ```
        sh install_nrgten.sh
        ```
        
        This will work on both Linux and Mac OS. For Windows the commands might be a little different (full Windows support will come when the package is on PyPi).
