.SH NAME
rmtoo-art-html \- requirements management tool: html artifact
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B rmtoo
requirment management tool is able to output one topic and all
possible subtopics including the containing requirements as a set of
HTML documents.
.P
Each HTML page is generated out of three parts: a header, a middle
part and a footer.  The header and footer are files which are copied
into each HTML page and are the same for all pages.  The middle part
is automatically generated.
.SH HEADER
The header must include the whole HTML header including the opening
html, full head and opening body tags.
.P
The header may also contain the definitions for the css tags which are
used in the middle part. See section \fBCSS\fR for more details.
.SH MIDDLE PART
The middle part is automatically generated.  The topic description is
used as a base for layout, text and requirements.
.SH FOOTER
The footer can contain arbritary HTML code.  It is copied to the end
of each page.  At least closing body and html tags must be included.
.SH CSS
Mostly each element in a requirement has a separate CSS class.
Therefore it is possible to format mostly every single bit of a
requirement output as wanted.  Please consult
\fIdoc/html/header.html\fR for an example.
Here is a list of all special
.B rmtoo
CSS classes used by the requirements output.  Of course additional
standard CSS classes or attributes (like h1, h2, a and so on) can be
defined.
.TP
\fBfltext\fR
The floating text which is specified in the \fIText:\fR tag in the
topic description.
.TP
\fBrequirment_end\fR
A separator can be defined here. This ends up a requirement.
.TP
\fBdlt_<name>\fR
The tag (key) of mostly all requirements keys can be defined. Example:
dlt_description 
.TP
\fBdlv_<name>\fR
The tag (key) of mostly all requirements keys can be defined. Example:
dlv_description
