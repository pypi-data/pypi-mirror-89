        # Overview
        This package provides an
        [Open Educational Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources)
        (OER) to refresh prior knowledge about functional dependencies (FDs)
        and normalization of relational database schemata.  Towards that goal,
        the package implements algorithms for the manipulation of functional
        dependencies; the package’s doc string explains the used vocabulary
        and contains examples.
        
        Selected algorithms:
        - FD.rminimize(): Return a minimal cover of r-minimal FDs
        - FDSet.closure(): Return closure of attributes under given FDs
        - FDSet.lminimize(): Return minimum subset of lhs that determines rhs
        - FDSet.key(): Return a key
        - FDSet.basis(): Return non-redundant r- and l-minimal basis
        - RelSchema.synthesize(): Normalize via synthesis into set of 3NF schemata
        
        # Side goal
        Besides, the package may serve as sample Python code that respects
        usual coding conventions, which are checked with
        [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com).
        The configuration file [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://gitlab.com/oer/cs/functional-dependencies/-/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
        specifies test tools used here.
        
        # Origin of code
        The code here is based on
        [that file](https://gitlab.com/oer/cs/programming/-/blob/master/functional_dependencies.py),
        which will not be maintained any longer.
