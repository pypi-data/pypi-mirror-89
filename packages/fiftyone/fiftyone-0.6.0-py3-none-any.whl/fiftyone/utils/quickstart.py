_QUICKSTART_GUIDE = """
Welcome to FiftyOne!

This quickstart downloaded a dataset from the Dataset Zoo and opened it in the
App. The dataset contains ground truth labels in a `ground_truth` field and
predictions from an off-the-shelf detector in a `predictions` field. It also
has a `uniqueness` field that indexes the dataset by visual uniqueness.

Here are some things you can do to explore the dataset:


(a) Double-click on an image to explore its labels in more detail


(b) Sort the dataset by uniqueness:

    - Click `add stage`
    - Select the `SortBy` stage
    - Select the `uniqueness` field

    Try setting `reverse` to `True` to show the *most unique* images first.
    Try setting `reverse` to `False` to show the *least unique* images first.


(c) Filter predictions by confidence

    The predictions field is noisy, but you can use FiftyOne to filter them!

    In the display options menu on the left, click on the `v` caret to the
    right of the `predictions` field to open a label filter. Drag the
    confidence slider to only include predictions with confidence at least 0.8!

_FILTER_DETECTIONS_IN_PYTHON = """
    You can also filter the detections from Python. Assuming you ran the
    quickstart like this::

        import fiftyone as fo

        dataset, session = fo.quickstart()

    Then you can filter the predictions by creating a view:

        from fiftyone import ViewField as F

        # Create a view that only contains predictions whose confidence is at
        # least 0.8
        high_conf_view = dataset.filter_detections(
            "predictions", F("confidence") > 0.8

        # Open the view in the App!

_VIDEO_QUICKSTART_GUIDE = """
Welcome to FiftyOne!

This quickstart downloaded a dataset from the Dataset Zoo and opened it in the
App. The dataset contains small video segments with dense object detections
generated by human annotators.

Here are some things you can do to explore the dataset:


(a) Hover over the videos in the grid view to play their contents

(b) Use the display options menu to toggle the frame labels on and off

(c) Double-click on a video to open the expanded view, and use the video player
    to scrub through the frames
