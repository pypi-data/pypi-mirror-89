On UNIX-like platforms, it includes a console demo that plays the game with automated players, intended for use by developers and not by end users.  See the [documentation](https://apologies.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for notes about the public interface.\n\nIt was written as a learning exercise and technology demonstration effort, and\nserves as a complete example of how to manage a modern (circa 2020) Python\nproject, including style checks, code formatting, integration with IntelliJ, CI\nbuilds at GitHub, and integration with PyPI and Read the Docs.\n',
