To install the latest GitHub version of PicturedRocks, do an "editable" installation of PicturedRocks:
```
git clone git@github.com:umangv/picturedrocks.git
cd picturedrocks
pip install -e .
```

PicturedRocks in compatible with `scanpy` and uses its `AnnData` objects. Most methods require cluster labels to be loaded. 

```python
from picturedrocks.read import read_clusts, process_clusts
adata = read_clusts(adata, "clust_labels.csv")
adata = process_clusts(adata)
```
