    Add support of running Patrole against a custom requirements YAML that
    defines RBAC requirements. The YAML file lists all the APIs and the roles
    that should have access to the APIs. The purpose of running Patrole against
    a requirements YAML is to verify that the RBAC policy is in accordance to
    deployment specific requirements. Running Patrole against a requirements
    YAML is completely optional and can be enabled by setting the
    ``[rbac] test_custom_requirements`` option to True in Tempest's
    configuration file. The requirements YAML must be located on the same host
    that Patrole runs on.
