A Python package implementing Structural Causal Models (SCM).

The library uses the CAS library [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) to allow the user to state arbitrary assignment functions and noise distributions as supported by SymPy and builds the DAG with [networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx).

It supports the features:
  - Sampling
  - Intervening
  - Plotting
  - Printing

 and by extension all methods on a DAG provided by networkx after accessing the member variable dag

# Installation
Either install via pip
```
pip install scmodels
```
or via cloning the repository and running the setup.py file
```
git clone https://github.com/maichmueller/scmodels
cd scmodels
python setup.py install
```

# Example usage

To build the DAG

![X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow Z \rightarrow X](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space;X{\rightarrow}{Y}{\leftarrow}{Z}{\rightarrow}X)


with the assignments

![Z ~ LogLogistic(alpha=1, beta=1)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space;Z\sim\text{LogLogistic}(\alpha=1,\beta=1)])

![X = 3Z^2{\cdot}N](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space;X={3Z^2}{\cdot}N\quad[N=\text{LogNormal}(\mu=1,\sigma=1)])

![Y = 2Z + \sqrt{X} + N](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space;Y=2Z+\sqrt{X}+N\quad[N=\text{Normal}(\mu=2,\sigma=1)])

one can describe the assignments as strings


```python
from scmodels import SCM

myscm = SCM(
    [
        "Z = N, N ~ LogLogistic(alpha=1, beta=1)",
        "X = N * 3 * Z ** 2, N ~ LogNormal(mean=1, std=1)",
        "Y = N + 2 * Z + sqrt(X), N ~ Normal(mean=2, std=1)"
    ]
)
```

or build the assignments piecewise themselves via an assignment map


```python
from sympy.stats import LogLogistic, LogNormal, Normal


assignment_map = {
   "Z": (
       "N",
       LogLogistic("N", alpha=1, beta=1)
   ),
   "X": (
       "N * 3 * Z ** 2",
       LogNormal("N", mean=1, std=1),
   ),
   "Y": (
       "N + 2 * Z + sqrt(X)",
       Normal("N", mean=2, std=1),
   ),
}

myscm = SCM(assignment_map)
```

The SCM supports a form of pretty printing its current setup, which includes mentioning active interventions
and the assignments


```python
print(myscm)
```

    Structural Causal Model of 3 variables: Z, X, Y
    Following variables are actively intervened on: []
    Current Assignments are:
    Z := f(N) = N	 [ N ~ LogLogistic(alpha=1, beta=1) ]
    X := f(N, Z) = N * 3 * Z ** 2	 [ N ~ LogNormal(mean=1, std=1) ]
    Y := f(N, X, Z) = N + 2 * Z + sqrt(X)	 [ N ~ Normal(mean=2, std=1) ]


One can easily perform interventions on the variables, e.g. a Do-intervention ![\text{do}(X=1=)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space;\text{do}(X=1))


```python
myscm.do_intervention([("X", 1)])
```

and sample as many samples from it as desired


```python
myscm.sample(5)
```



<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>X</th>
      <th>Z</th>
      <th>Y</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1.037087</td>
      <td>6.206237</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0.207293</td>
      <td>2.278741</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>4.479058</td>
      <td>11.089535</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0.574231</td>
      <td>4.807162</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>7.216779</td>
      <td>17.946997</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



The current intervention is also noted in its string representation


```python
print(myscm)
```

    Structural Causal Model of 3 variables: Z, X, Y
    Following variables are actively intervened on: ['X']
    Current Assignments are:
    Z := f(N) = N	 [ N ~ LogLogistic(alpha=1, beta=1) ]
    X := f(N) = 1	 [ N ~ LogNormal(mean=1, std=1) ]
    Y := f(N, X, Z) = N + 2 * Z + sqrt(X)	 [ N ~ Normal(mean=2, std=1) ]


which can be restored to the initial status via undoing the intervention


```python
myscm.undo_intervention()
```

If you have graphviz installed, you can also use it to plot the DAG easily

```python
myscm.plot(node_size=1000, alpha=1)
```

![example_plot](https://github.com/maichmueller/scm/blob/master/docs/images/example_plot.png)


```python

```
