v7.2.0
======

* #27: Switched to native ``svg`` namespace (PEP 420).

v7.1.1
======

* Refresh package metadata and minor cleanups.

v7.1.0
======

* #23: Plots now round labels to 4 digits of precision.

v7.0.0
======

(unreleased)

* Require Python 3.6 or later.

6.1
===

* Rely on `importlib.resources
  <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources>`_
  for loading resources from the package.
* Packaging refresh.

6.0
===

* #26: Drop support for Python 3.4 and earlier (including 2.7).

5.0
===

* #24: Switched from ``pkg_resource``-style namespace
  package for ``svg`` to a `pkgutil style
  <https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages>`_
  namespace package.

4.0.1
=====

* #22: Now ``burn`` uses text mode to write the data,
  giving a more normal experience on Python 3.
* Refreshed project metadata.

4.0
===

* Removed support for ``compress`` flag on Graphs.
  Simply invoke ``zlib.compress`` on the data if needed.

* ``Graph.burn`` now returns the rendered SVG as a
  Unicode string without XML declaration and without
  pretty-printing. To customize the XML rendering,
  override or replace the ``Graph.render`` static method.

3.4.4
=====

* #17: Fix issue in subclassed Line charts.

3.4.3
=====

* Minor tweak to README for better rendering in PyPI.

3.4.2
=====

* Update docs link.

3.4.1
=====

* #16: Restore support for passing iterable data elements.

3.4
===

Issue #14:

* ``svg.charts.plot.Plot``
  (and hence its subclass ``svg.charts.time_series.Plot``)
  now accept data as a sequence of pairs.  Example::

      import svg.charts.plot

      g = svg.charts.plot.Plot()
      g.add_data(dict(title='Example',
                      data=[(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)]))

* data point labels that are drawn when
  ``show_data_values = True`` can have their label changed
  from the default (which is the y-value) by giving a data item
  a ``.text`` attribute.
  It is convenient to used ``namedtuple()`` for this::

      import svg.charts.plot
      from collections import namedtuple

      Datum = nametuple("Datum", 'x y text')

      g = svg.charts.plot.Plot()
      g.add_data(dict(title='Example',
                      data=[Datum(1, 1, 'first'),
                            Datum(2, 4, 'second'),
                            Datum(3, 9, 'third')]))

  (in fact data items can have any extra attribute;
  only ``.text`` is used currently)

3.3.1
=====

* #13: Fix issues in lazy-evaluated iterators.

3.3
===

* #12: The library now provides an ``svg.charts.graph.DrawHooks``
  mix-in for customizing the draw behavior.
* Cleaned up documentation.

3.2
===

* #8: Subtitle is now rendering the subtitle and not the title
  again.
* #9: ``Bar`` objects now expose a ``_fill_class`` method
  for overriding the default CSS fill class. It's now possible
  to create a custom subclass that generates the fill based
  on the field index as well. For example::

      class VerticalBar(svg.charts.bar.VerticalBar):
          key = False

          def _fill_class(self, dataset_index, field_index):
              fill_index = 1 + dataset_index + field_index*len(self.data)
              return 'fill%s' % fill_index

3.1
===

* Adding a couple small dependencies eliminated a lot of duplicated code
  in the ``util`` module.
* Corrected error when ``stacked`` was used in Line charts.

3.0
===

* Dropped support for Python 2.6.
* Requires setuptools for installation.
* Filter out comments when parsing CSS.
* Corrected errors in ``Graph.render_inline_styles``.

2.3
===

* #4: Added hook in Graph to allow overriding of the attributes on the
  root SVG element. One can now override or monkeypatch
  ``Graph._get_root_attributes`` to alter the rendering of the root
  attributes such as width and height. For example, to omit width and height::

    class MyPlot(plot.Plot):
        def _get_root_attributes(self):
            attrs = super(MyPlot, self)._get_root_attributes()
            del attrs['width']
            del attrs['height']
            return attrs

2.2.2
=====

* #1: Fixed javascript ID names in TimeSeries labels.

2.2.1
=====

* #5: Fixed references to class attributes in ``graph.py``.

2.2
===

* SF Issue #1: Fixed installation on Unix systems again. Author's preference
  for lowercase ``readme.txt`` was trumped by `setuptools #100
  <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/100/>`_.
* Moved hosting to BitBucket.
* Established Continuous Integration Tests on Github mirror using Travis-CI.

2.1
===

* Project now builds and tests pass on Python 3 without 2to3.

2.0.9
=====

* Corrected buggy logic in y-axis label rendering (thanks to Emmanuel
  Blot).
* Converted to Unix line endings.

2.0.8
=====

* Updated to latest cssutils with Python 3 support. Thanks Christof!
* Fixed a few remaining issues with Python 3 compatibility.

2.0.7
=====

* Fixed bug in rendering of Pie Chart styles.
* Improved testing framework. Now samples are at least generated as part
  of the test suite.
* Fixed bug in javascript when label ids had spaces. See #3139197.
* Fixed build issue where package data wasn't included due to 2to3
  technique. Now using distribute technique and installation on Python
  3 requires distribute.

2.0.6
=====

* Fixed bug where x axis labels would not be rendered properly if the
  largest value was the same as the largest visible x value on the
  chart.

2.0.5
=====

* Altered the way CSS files are loaded, so they can be more easily
  customized by subclasses (and less dependent on the class names).

2.0.4
=====

* A small attempt to improve the documentation - added links to examples
  that already exist.

2.0.3
=====

* Fix IndexError in ``svg.charts.plot.Plot.field_size`` when there are
  only two values returned by float_range (in the case there are only
  two different 'y' values in the data) and scale_y_integers == True.
  Credit to `Jean Schurger <http://schurger.org/>`_ for the patch.
* Fixed problem in setup.py installing on Unix OS (case sensitivity of
  readme.txt). Credit to Luke Miller and Jean Schurger for supplying
  a patch for this issue.

2.0.2
=====

* Updated cssutils dependency to 0.9.6 (currently in beta) to require the CSS profiles support.
* Completed an SVG CSS profile according to the SVG 1.1 spec.

2.0.1
=====

* Added preliminary SVG CSS profile, suitable for stock CSS properties.

2.0
=====

* First major divergence from the Ruby reference implementation
* Now implemented as a namespace package (svg.charts instead of svg_charts)
* Changed XML processor to lxml
* Enabled extensible css support using cssutils, greatly reducing static CSS
* Renamed modules and methods to be more consistent with PEP-8 naming convention

Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0

I suggest removing SVG 1.0 from the python installation.  This involves removing the
SVG directory (or svg_chart*) from site-packages.

Change import statements to import from the new namespace, so::

    from SVG import Bar
    Bar.VerticalBar(...)

becomes::

    from svg.charts import bar
    bar.VerticalBar(...)
