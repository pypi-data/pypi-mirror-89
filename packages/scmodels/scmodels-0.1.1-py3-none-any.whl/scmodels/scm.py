class SCM:
    """
    Class building a Structural Causal Model.

    With this class one can sample causally from the underlying graph and also perform do-interventions and
    soft-interventions, as well as more general interventions targeting one or more variables with arbitrary
    changes to the assignment and/or noise structure (including parent-child relationship changes).

    For visualization aid, the SCM can plot itself and also print a summary of itself to the console.
    To this end, the decision was made to limit the potential input to the SCM objects in terms of
    functional and noise functors.
    If a user wishes to add a custom functional or noise function to their usage of the SCM, they will need
    to provide implementations inheriting from the respective base classes of noise or functional.

    Notes
    -----
    When constructing or intervening the user is responsible to guarantee acyclicity in the SCM. No checks are enabled
    at this stage.

        Construct the SCM from an assignment map with the variables as keys and its assignment information

        Notes

        Note, that the assignment string needs to align with the parents list namewise!

        Examples
        --------
        To set up 3 variables of the form

        .. math::   Y = 2 * X_0 - sqrt(X_1) + Normal(2, 1)

        we can either build an assignment map

        or we can build the SCM directly from assignment strings

        >>> causal_net = SCM(

        ----------

        variable_tex_names: (optional) Dict,
            A collection of the latex names for the variables in the causal graph. The dict needs to provide a tex name
            for each passed variable name in the form: {"VarName": "VarName_in_TeX"}.
            Any variable that is missing in the dictionary will be assumed to accept its current name as the TeX
            version.
            If not provided defaults to the input names in the functional map.

        Plot the causal graph of the bayesian_graphs in a dependency oriented way.

        However, because a causal graph is a DAG and can thus have directionless cycles (but not directional cycles), a
        tree structure often can't be computed. Therefore this method relies on graphviz to compute a feasible
        representation of the causal graph.

        The graphviz package has been marked as an optional package for this module and therefore needs to be installed
        by the user.
        Note, that graphviz may demand further libraries to be supplied, thus the following
        command should install the necessary dependencies on Ubuntu, if graphviz couldn't be found on your system.
        Open a terminal and type:

            ``sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config``

            Default is 500.
        figsize : (optional) tuple,

        dpi : (optional) int,
            the dots per inch arg for matplotlib. Default is 150.

    Based on Joel's answer at https://stackoverflow.com/a/29597209/2966723,
    but with some modifications.

    We include this because it may be useful for plotting transmission trees,
    and there is currently no networkx equivalent (though it may be coming soon).

    There are two basic approaches we think of to allocate the horizontal
    location of a node.

    - Top down: we allocate horizontal space to a node.  Then its ``k``
      descendants split up that horizontal space equally.  This tends to result
      in overlapping nodes when some have many descendants.
    - Bottom up: we allocate horizontal space to each leaf node.  A node at a
      higher level gets the entire space allocated to its descendant leaves.
      Based on this, leaf nodes at higher levels get the same space as leaf
      nodes very deep in the tree.

    We use use both of these approaches simultaneously with ``leaf_vs_root_factor``
    determining how much of the horizontal space is based on the bottom up
    or top down approaches.  ``0`` gives pure bottom up, while 1 gives pure top
    down.


    Parameters
    ----------
    **G** the graph (must be a tree)

    **root** the root node of the tree
    - if the tree is directed and this is not given, the root will be found and used
    - if the tree is directed and this is given, then the positions will be
      just for the descendants of this node.
    - if the tree is undirected and not given, then a random choice will be used.

    **width** horizontal space allocated for this branch - avoids overlap with other branches

    **vert_gap** gap between levels of hierarchy

    **vert_loc** vertical location of root

    **leaf_vs_root_factor**
