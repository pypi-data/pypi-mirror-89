Zero is a general-purpose library for PyTorch users. Zero:

- simplifies training loop, models evaluation, models application and other typical Deep
  Learning tasks
- provides a collection of "building blocks" and leaves code organization to you
- can be used on its own or together with PyTorch frameworks such as
  `Ignite <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite>`_,
  `Lightning <https://github.com/PytorchLightning/pytorch-lightning>`_,
  `Catalyst <https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst>`_ and
  `others <https://pytorch.org/ecosystem>`_

**NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USAGE.** Zero is tested, but not battle-tested. You can give
it a try in non-mission-critical research.

Installation
------------

If you plan to use the GPU version of PyTorch, install it **before** installing Zero
(otherwise, the CPU version will be installed together with Zero).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install libzero

Why "Zero"?
-----------

Zero aims to be `zero-overhead <https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/big-picture#zero-overhead-principle>`_
in terms of *mental* overhead: solutions, provided by Zero, try to
be as minimal, intuitive and easy to learn, as possible. Well, all these things can be
pretty subjective, so don't take it too seriously :wink:
