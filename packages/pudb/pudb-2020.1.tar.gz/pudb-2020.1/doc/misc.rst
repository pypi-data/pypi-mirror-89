support that version of Python. urwid 1.1.1 works with Python 2.5, newer
versions do not.

FAQ
---

**Q: I navigated to the Variables/Stack/Breakpoints view.  How do I get
back to the source view?**

A: Press your left arrow key.

**Q: Where are breakpoints stored?**

A: All PuDB information is stored in a location specified by the `XDG Base
Directory Specification
<http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_.
Usually, it is ``~/.config/pudb``.  Breakpoints are stored in a file called
``saved-breakpoints``.  Also in this location are the shell history from the
``!`` shell (``shell-history``) and the PuDB settings (``pudb.cfg``).

**Q: I killed PuDB and now my terminal is broken.  How do I fix it?**

A: Type the ``reset`` command (even if you cannot see what you are typing, it
should work).  If this happens on a regular basis, please report it as a bug.
