features:
  - |
    Implemented a new method ``override_role`` in ``rbac_utils`` module, which
    provides the exact same functionality as the now-deprecated ``switch_role``
    method, with one difference: ``override_role`` is a contextmanager which
    provides better policy validation granularity. This means that immediately
    after the contextmanager's code has executed, the role is switched back
    to the admin role automatically.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``switch_role`` method in ``rbac_utils`` module has been deprecated
    and will be removed during the Rocky release cycle.
