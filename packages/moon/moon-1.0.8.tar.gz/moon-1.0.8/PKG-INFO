Description: # moon 
        
        This is a small python package that simply gets an numpy array of an image of a given date's moon phase. It uses numpy, opencv and Ernie Wright's moon visualizations from the Dial-a-Moon project at Nasa Visualization Studio.
        
        At time of publishing, this package can access any of the moon visualizations from 2011-2020. I suppose the way it's set up now, it'll need an update before the end of 2020, and perhaps I'll find a better way to set it up by then.
        
        # Installation 
        
        To install this package, just run 
        
        ```pip install moon```
        
        # Usage
        
        Currently, this package will return a numpy array representing the lunar phase, as well as some json of the lunar stats from the Dial-a-Moon Nasa site. This array is usable as an image using openCV, or can be saved to disk as a .jpg file.
        
        You can test it out using terminal:
        
        ```
        from moon.terminal_ui import TerminalUi
        
        ui = TerminalUi()
        ui.set_moon_phase() #defaults to today's date
        ui.show()
        ```
        
        You can alternately test it out using Jupyter notebooks:
        
        ```
        from moon.jupyter_ui import JupyterUi
        
        ui = JupyterUi()
        ui.set_moon_phase() #defaults to today's date
        ui.show()
        ```
        
        To just use it in a project, you can use it like this:
        
        ```
        from moon.dialamoon import Moon
        
        moon = Moon()
        moon.set_moon_phase()
        
        ```
        and access the image array itself with
        
        ```
        moon.image
        ```
        
        At the moment, there isn't any built in method for converting the numpy array to a Pillow image. I had this set up with Pillow originally, but it fell by the wayside when I moved over to playing around with openCV. 
        
        # Updates
        
        Please feel free to post bugs, suggestions and feature requests on this repo. Through some trial and error, I think I finally have the package as simple as possible, but I'm open to evolution. This will be my first time creating and maintaining a python package, and I am receptive to any tips or PRs as far as best-practices go.
