    "# Cluster submission from notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to take code from BESOS and run it on ComputeCanada cluster resources.  \n",
    "To run BESOS modules on ComputeCanada cluster resources, you will need:\n",
    "+ A ComputeCanada account with the following installed:\n",
    "    + `python 3` and `glpk` (both can be loaded with `module load`).\n",
    "    + `bonmin` and `energyplus`.\n",
    "    + `besos` (pip installable).  \n",
    "    \n",
    "You can also obviously develop Python files that use the BESOS modules locally and submit them to the cluster via your usual method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall process\n",
    "The general process is as follows:\n",
    "+ Write your code to a .py file\n",
    "    + As shown below, you can write out a single cell from your notebook by adding `%%writefile filename.py` at the top  \n",
    "    This has the advantage that you can test your code on BESOS, then uncomment this line.\n",
    "    + To output a whole notebook, select File, Export Notebook As... and select Executable Script\n",
    "+ Write a batch file to submit it\n",
    "    + We use the `%%writefile` method below\n",
    "+ Execute the follwing steps in the terminal (here we use a window inside a notebook cell, or open a seperate terminal tab):\n",
    "    + Move the files over using SFTP (see [here](SFTP.ipynb)).\n",
    "    + Submit the job\n",
    "    + Copy back the results files using SFTP\n",
    "+ Unpickle the results and continue post-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst this process is somewhat cumbersome, it can be convienient for novice terminal users to use the cell below as a crib sheet of commands.  \n",
    "We recommend copying snippets of this notebook and the [SFTP](SFTP.ipynb) one together to make your own workflow."
