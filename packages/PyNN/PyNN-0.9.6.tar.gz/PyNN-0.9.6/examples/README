- RUNNING EXAMPLES
-------------------------------

1. If you want to run all the examples with a specific simulator (nest, neuron, brian or mock), you write the following commands:

> cd tools
> python run_all_examples.py NEST/NEURON/Brian/MOCK

The logs, results and the plots as png files will all be put in tools/Results/*. 

Note that 'mock' is a dummy backend, used to check the syntax of your PyNN code.


2. If you want to run all the examples with all the available simulators, just run the run_all_examples.py script without argument:

> cd tools
> python run_all_examples.py 

The logs, results and the plots as png files will all be put in tools/Results/*.
