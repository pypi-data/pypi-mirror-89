        # HTSeq

        A Python library to facilitate processing and analysis of data
        from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) experiments. A popular use of ``HTSeq``
        is ``htseq-count``, a tool to quantify gene expression in RNA-Seq and similar
        experiments.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        To use ``HTSeq`` you will need:
        
        -  ``Python >= 3.6`` (**note**: ``Python 2.7`` support has been dropped)
        -  ``numpy``
        -  ``pysam``
        
        To run the ``htseq-qa`` script, you will also need:
        
        -  ``matplotlib``
        
        Both **Linux** and **OSX** are supported and binaries are provided on Pypi. We
        would like to support **Windows** but currently lack the expertise to do so. If
        you would like to take on the Windows release and maintenance, please open an
        issue and we'll try to help.
        
        A source package which should not require ``Cython`` nor ``SWIG`` is also
        provided on Pypi.
        
        To **develop** `HTSeq` you will **also** need:
        
        -  ``Cython >=0.29.5``
        -  ``SWIG >=3.0.8``
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### PIP
        
        To install directly from PyPI:
        
        ```bash
        pip install HTSeq
        ```
        
        To install a specific version:
        
        ```bash
        pip install 'HTSeq==0.14.0'
        ```
        
        If this fails, please install all dependencies first:
        
        ```bash
        pip install matplotlib
        pip install Cython
        pip install pysam
        pip install HTSeq
        ```
        
        ### setup.py (distutils/setuptools)
        
        Install the dependencies with your favourite tool (``pip``, ``conda``,
        etc.).
        
        To install ``HTSeq`` itself, run:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py build install
        ```
