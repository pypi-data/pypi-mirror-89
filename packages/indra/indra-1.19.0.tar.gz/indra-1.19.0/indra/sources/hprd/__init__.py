This module implements geting content from the Human Protein Reference
Database (HPRD), a curated protein data resource, as INDRA Statements.
In particular, the module supports extracting post-translational
modifications, protein complexes, and (binary) protein-protein interactions
from HPRD.

More information about HPRD can be obtained at

  initial platform for approaching systems biology in humans. Genome Research.
