--------------------

Fixed a bug which makes it impossible to create the makefile
dependencies when there was no git repository available for the
requirements. (Thanks to Grotefeld)

Add a pygit compatibility layer.  This version of rmtoo should now
work with version 0.1.6 (with comes with some linux distributions) and
also with version 0.2.0 (which is the latest beta).

Readded the command line options '-p', '-o' and '-l' which vanished
during refactoring of the input / output handling in version 7.  These
options are depricated and will vanish in some versions.

Add first version of xml output handling class.

Add experimental output class for writing ganntproject xml files. This
output class is alpha software at the moment. It is not decided if
this is supported in future: there are some major open problems with
this interface.


Internal Changes
----------------

Output methods are factored out in a separate class. (Including the
Makefile depency handling.)
