Description: 
                scdata - Module for analysis of sensors and time series data.
        
                scdata is a framework built with the purpose of *analysis*, *calibration* 
                and *post-processing* of sensors data, related to any field, but particularly 
                focused on air-quality data coming from low-cost sensors in the 
                `Smart Citizen Project <https://www.smartcitizen.me>`__ .
        
                It aims to unify several sources of data and to provide tools for analysing data by:
        
                * Interacting with several sensors APIs
                * Clean data, export and calculate metrics
                * Model sensor data and calibrate sensors
                * Generate data visualisations
