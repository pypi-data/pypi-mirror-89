Description: # rev-seqs: Revert Sequences to Consensus Preserving Variants
        
        rev-seqs is a command line utility to revert sequences to consensus preserving variants detected in a VCF file. It reverts all other positions the sample consensus
        
        # Usage
        Once installed rev-seqs is just a simple command line command.
        
        ```shell
        python -m revseqs --input <input file> --vcf <vcf file> > <output_file>
        ```
        
        run `python revseqs -h` for more options
        
        The new bam file is written to standard output.
        Input file must be an indexed bam file
        
        ## Inserts
        Any inserts that are not flagged as variants are removed, those inserts along with sample header are printed to standard error. The sample name is followed by a comma separated list of insert positions that were removed.
        
        To save this file for future inspect redirect standard error to a file using the command below 
        
        ```shell
        python -m revseqs --input <input.bam> --vcf <variants.vcf> > <output.bam> 2> <inserts>
        ```
        
        # Installation
        
        ```shell
        pip install rev-seqs
        ```
