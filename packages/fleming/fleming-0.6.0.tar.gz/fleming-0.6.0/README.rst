Fleming
=======

Fleming contains a set of routines for doing datetime manipulation. Named
after `Sandford Fleming`_, the father of worldwide standard timezones, this
package is meant to aid datetime manipulations with regards to timezones.

Fleming addresses some of the common difficulties with timezones and datetime
objects, such as performing arithmetic and datetime truncation across a
Daylight Savings Time border. It also provides utilities for generating date
ranges and getting unix times with respect to timezones.

Fleming accepts pytz timezone objects as parameters, and it is assumed that the
user has a basic understanding of pytz. Click `here`_ for more information
about pytz.
