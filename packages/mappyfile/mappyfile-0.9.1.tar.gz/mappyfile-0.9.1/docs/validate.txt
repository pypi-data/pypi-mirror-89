Usage: mappyfile validate [OPTIONS] [MAPFILES]...

  Validate Mapfile(s) against the Mapfile schema

  The MAPFILES argument is a list of paths, either to individual Mapfiles,
  or a folders containing Mapfiles.  Wildcards are supported (natively on
  Linux, and up to one level deep on Windows). Validation errors are
  reported to the console. The program returns the error count - this will
  be 0 if no validation errors are encountered.

  Example of validating a single Mapfile:

      mappyfile validate C:/Temp/valid.map

  Example of validating two folders containing Mapfiles, without expanding
  INCLUDES:

      mappyfile validate C:/Temp/*.map
      D:/GitHub/mappyfile/tests/mapfiles/*.map --no-expand

Options:
  --expand / --no-expand  Expand any INCLUDE directives found in the Mapfile
                          [default: True]
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
