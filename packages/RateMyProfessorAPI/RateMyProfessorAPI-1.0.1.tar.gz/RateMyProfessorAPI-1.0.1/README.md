## Usage
As of version 1.0.0, there are limited ways to retrieve professor ratings. 
Only ratings, difficulty ratings, and names can be displayed at this time.

To retrieve a list of professors, you have to first specify the school:
```python
ratemyprofessor.get_school_by_name("School Name here")
```
This will return `None` if no school is found corresponding with that name. 
Alternatively, to search for multiple schools, use
```python
ratemyprofessor.get_schools_by_name("School Name here")
```
This will return a list of `School`s.

Using the `School` object obtained from the previous commands, you can use that to find the professor:
```python
ratemyprofessor.get_professor_by_school_and_name(school, "Professor Name") 
```
where school refers to a `School` object.
Alternatively, to search for multiple professors, use
```python
ratemyprofessor.get_professor_by_schools_and_name(school, "Professor Name") 
```
This will return a list of `Professor`s.

Each `Professor` object has a `rating`, `difficulty`, `id`, and `name`.

Each `School` object has a 'id' and 'name'.

## Example
```python
import ratemyprofessor

professor = ratemyprofessor.get_professor_by_school_and_name(
    ratemyprofessor.get_school_by_name("Case Western Reserve University"), "Connamacher")
print(f"Professor name: {professor.name}")
print(f"Professor rating: {professor.rating} / 5.0")
print(f"Professor difficulty: {professor.difficulty} / 5.0")
```

**Output:**
```
Professor name: Harold Connamacher
Professor rating: 4.7 / 5.0
Professor difficulty: 3.8 / 5.0
```
