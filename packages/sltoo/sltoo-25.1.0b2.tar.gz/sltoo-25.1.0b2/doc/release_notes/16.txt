--------------------

For specifying dependencies between requirements, the 'Solved by' tag
should be used starting from this release.  This is the more 'natural'
way of specifying dependencies and has some other advantages (please
consult the document doc/other/HowToDigraph.txt for more details).
The old 'Depends on' is still supported - but new projects should use
the new way.

Maximum line length is now configurable - separately for requirements
and topics.

Fixed a bug which results in a stack trace when the line length was
too long. (Thanks to radar8)

LaTeX2 output: changed 'Dependent' to 'Solved by'.


Internal Changes
----------------

Added more test cases.

New TXT file parser was added - but not yet activated, because
currently there is one incompatibility to the old version. Because the
new parser does not allow comments in a value, i.e. comments between
the tag line and a continuation line and between two continuation
lines, this was not activated.
