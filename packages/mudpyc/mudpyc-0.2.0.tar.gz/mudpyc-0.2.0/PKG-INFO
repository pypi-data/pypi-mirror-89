Description: 
        MudPyC is a client for MUDs written in Python.
        
        A MUD is a text-based multi-user role-playing game. If you don't already
        know what that is, you're probably looking at the wrong package.
        
        MudPyC will do it all: sophisticated mapping, macros and shortcuts, support
        for combat, and whatnot. The idea is to be MUD-, frontend- and
        language-independent, with configurable extension modules for popular MUDs.
        
        We're not there yet. The current version has only been tested with the
        German "Morgengrauen" MUD and the only front-end it supports is a lightly
        modified version of Mudlet. On the plus side, MudPyC is able to import your
        existing maps from Mudlet.
