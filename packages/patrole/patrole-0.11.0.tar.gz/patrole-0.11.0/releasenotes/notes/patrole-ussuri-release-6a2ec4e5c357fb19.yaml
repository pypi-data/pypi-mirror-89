    This release is to tag the Patrole for OpenStack Ussuri release.
    This release marks the start of Ussuri release support in Patrole.
    After this release, Patrole will support below OpenStack Releases:

      * Ussuri
      * Train
      * Stein

    Current development of Patrole is for OpenStack Victoria development
    cycle. Every Patrole commit is also tested against master during
    the Victoria cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Patrole as of this tag will work against a Victoria (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Ussuri release.
