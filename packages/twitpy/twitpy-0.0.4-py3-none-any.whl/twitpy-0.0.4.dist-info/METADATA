# Setup twitpy
Let's install twitpy first and tweepy.
```
pip install twitpy
and 
pip install tweepy
```
We are installing tweepy because i'm using tweepy to access the twitter API.

Now we need to actually setup the module by registring our API Keys.

```python 
import twitpy
Access = twitpy.accesstwitpy("access_token","access_token_secret","consumer_key","consumer_key_secret")
```
You need 4 API keys to access twitpy. You need a Twitter Developer Account for this, This is the MOST important step and without doing this you will not be able to access the API.

Now we have succesfully Accessed twitpy, Now we will use it's features.

# Picking user from retweet (retweet picker)

Using the `Access` variable we defined before to gain access into twitpy we will now Use it's inbuilt retweet picker.

```python
retweeted_winner = Access.pickuserfrom_retweet(131429358258)
print(retweeted_winner.username)
```
In the parenthesis of `pickuserfrom_retweet` we specify the tweet ID, if the tweet id is valid and it has more than 0 retweets it will pick a user, `pickuserfrom_retweet` returns the following attributes you can use.

```
username
name
userid
followers
following
```

# Getting tweets from a user

Now we will use the `Access` Variable to get a specific amount of tweets (< 10) from a user.

```python
gettweets = Access.get_tweetsfromuser("OHrefineddev",10)
for i in gettweets:
    print(i.full_text)
```
In the parenthesis of `get_tweetsfromuser` we write the Username first then we write the amount of tweets we want from the user, the number of tweets should be under 10,because `gettweets` was a list due to having 10 tweets it has to be looped through, `get_tweetsfromuser` returns the following attributes.

```
full_text
id
favorite_count : Likes
retweet_count : Retweets
created_at
source
```

# Finding a user on twitter

Now we will use the `Access` Variable to find a user on twitter.

```python
user = Access.find_user("OHrefineddev")
print(user.userid)
```
In the parenthesis of `find_user` we write the user's username, `find_user` returns the following attributes.

```
username
name
userid
created_at
description
followers
following
location 
tweets_count : Total tweets from the user.
