Overview
============

For a given (background-subtracted) image and a corresponding segmentation map
indicating the source(s) of interest, statmorph calculates the following
morphological statistics for each source:

- Gini-M20 statistics (Lotz et al. 2004; Snyder et al. 2015a,b)
- Concentration, Asymmetry and Smoothness (CAS) statistics
  (Bershady et al. 2000; Conselice 2003; Lotz et al. 2004)
- Multimode, Intensity and Deviation (MID) statistics (Freeman et al. 2013;
  Peth et al. 2016)
- Outer asymmetry and shape asymmetry (Wen et al. 2014; Pawlik et al. 2016)
- Sérsic index (Sérsic 1968)
- Several shape and size measurements associated to the above statistics
  (ellipticity, Petrosian radius, half-light radius, etc.)

The current Python implementation is largely based on IDL and Python code
originally written by Jennifer Lotz and Greg Snyder.
