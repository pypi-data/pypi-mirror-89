    EARTH

    Landsat imagery is provided to the public as a joint project between
    NASA and USGS. Earth Data is powered by EOSDIS.

    NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) is a key
    core capability in the Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program.
    It provides end-to-end capabilities for managing NASA Earth science data
    from various sourcesâ€”satellites, aircraft, field measurements, and various
    other programs. For the EOS satellite missions, EOSDIS provides
    capabilities for command and control, scheduling, data capture and initial
    (level 0) processing. These capabilities, constituting the EOSDIS Mission
    Operations, are managed by NASA's Earth Science Mission Operations (ESMO)
    Project. NASA network capabilities transport the data to the science
    operations facilities.
