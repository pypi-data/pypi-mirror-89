About
-----

Statecharts are a well-known visual modeling language for specifying the executable behavior
of reactive event-based systems. The essential complexity of statechart models solicits the need for advanced model testing and validation techniques. Sismic is a statechart library for Python (version 3.5 or higher) providing a set of tools to define, validate, simulate, execute and test statecharts. *Sismic* is a recursive acronym that stands for *Sismic Interactive Statechart Model Interpreter and Checker*.

Sismic is mainly developed by Dr. Alexandre Decan as part of his research activities at the `Software Engineering Lab <http://informatique.umons.ac.be/genlog>`_ of the `University of Mons <http://www.umons.ac.be>`_. Sismic is released
as open source under the  `GNU Lesser General Public Licence version 3.0 (LGPLv3) <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>`_.

The scientific article `A method for testing and validating executable statechart models <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-018-0676-3>`_, published in 2018 in the Springer Software & Systems Modeling journal, describes the method and techniques for modeling, testing and validating statecharts, as supported by Sismic.

Features
--------

Sismic provides the following features:

- An easy way to define and to import statecharts, based on the human-friendly YAML markup language
- A statechart interpreter offering a discrete, step-by-step, and fully observable simulation engine
- Fully controllable simulation clock, with support for real and simulated time
- Built-in support for expressing actions and guards using regular Python code, can be easily extended to other programming languages
- A design-by-contract approach for statecharts: contracts can be specified to express invariants, pre- and postconditions on states and transitions
- Runtime checking of behavioral properties expressed as statecharts
- Built-in support for behavior-driven development
- Support for communication between statecharts
- Synchronous and asynchronous executions
- Statechart visualization using `PlantUML <http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml>`__


The semantics of the statechart interpreter is based on the specification of the SCXML semantics (with a few exceptions),
but can be easily tuned to other semantics.
Sismic statecharts provides full support for the majority of the UML 2 statechart concepts:

- simple states, composite states, orthogonal (parallel) states, initial and final states, shallow and deep history states
- state transitions, guarded transitions, automatic (eventless) transitions, internal transitions and transition priorities
- statechart variables and their initialisation
- state entry and exit actions, transition actions
- internal and external events, parametrized events, delayed events
