About
*****

When trying to get a changelog for a given package, there are a bunch of problems:

- There is no central place to store a changelog. If a project has a changelog, it's most likely somewhere in the git repo at all kinds of different places. This makes it hard to find.
- The package index meta data often has no direct link to the git repo. This makes the repo hard to find.
- There is no changelog standard. Everyone uses a different approach. This makes it hard to parse.

This project is trying to solve this by:

- first querying the package vendor for package meta data like the homepage or docs URL.
- if the meta data doesn't contain a valid URL to a repo, visit all available URLs and scrape them to find one.
- if there is a valid repo URL, visit the repo and look for possible changelogs like `Changes.txt`, `NEWS.md` or `history.rst`.
- fetch the content and somewhat try to parse it.
