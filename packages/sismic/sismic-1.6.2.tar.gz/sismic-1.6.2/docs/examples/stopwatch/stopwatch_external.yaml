  description: |
    A simple stopwatch which support "start", "stop", "split", and "reset".
    These features are triggered respectively using "start", "stop", "split", and "reset".

    The stopwatch expects a "stopwatch" object in its initial context.
    This object should support the following methods: "start", "stop", "split", "reset", and "unsplit".
  root state:
    name: active
    parallel states:
      - name: timer
        initial: stopped
        transitions:
          - event: reset
            action: stopwatch.reset()
        states:
          - name: running
            transitions:
              - event: stop
                target: stopped
                action: stopwatch.stop()
          - name: stopped
            transitions:
              - event: start
                target: running
                action: stopwatch.start()

        initial: actual time
        states:

            transitions:
