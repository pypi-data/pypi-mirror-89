   :alt: 

QIF is a format widely used by personal money management software such
as `GnuCash <http://www.gnucash.org/>`__ to import information. Yet, the
import process is particularly tedious as it require to manually pair
the transactions contained in the file with categories (or "accounts"
for double-entry bookkeeping systems).

qifqif augment your qif files by adding a category line for each
transaction, that additional information can then be used by accounting
software to perform automatic QIF imports. It picks categories by
searching for predefined keywords in transactions descriptions lines and
by repeating choices you previously made regarding similar transactions.

Features
--------

-  **Quickstart:** create categories by importing your existing accounts
   with `qifacc <https://github.com/Kraymer/qifqif/wiki/qifacc>`__
-  **Blazing fast edits:** thanks to well-thought-out defaults and
   ``<TAB>`` completion
-  **Auditing mode:** review your transactions one by one
-  **Batch mode (no interactive):** for easy integration with scripts
-  **Easy-going workflow:** dreading the behemoth task of importing
   years of accounting from a single file? Don't be. Go at your own pace
   and press ``<Ctrl+C>`` to exit anytime. On next run, editing will
   resume right where you left it.
