class AsyncRunner:
    """
    An asynchronous runner that repeatedly execute given interpreter.

    The runner tries to call its `execute` method every `interval` seconds, assuming
    that a call to that method takes less time than `interval`.
    If not, subsequent call is queued and will occur as soon as possible with
    no delay. The runner stops as soon as the underlying interpreter reaches
    a final configuration.

    The execution must be started with the `start` method, and can be (definitively)
    stopped with the `stop` method. An execution can be temporarily suspended
    using the `pause` and `unpause` methods. A call to `wait` blocks until
    the statechart reaches a final configuration.

    The current state of a runner can be obtained using its `running` and
    `paused` properties.

    While this runner can be used "as is", it is designed to be subclassed and
    as such, proposes several hooks to control the execution and additional
    behaviours:

     - before_run: called (only once !) when the runner is started. By default, do nothing.
     - after_run: called (only once !) when the interpreter reaches a final configuration.
       configuration of the underlying interpreter is reached. By default, do nothing.
     - execute: called at each step of the run. By default, call the `execute_once`
       method of the underlying interpreter and returns a *list* of macro steps.
     - before_execute: called right before the call to `execute()`. By default, do nothing.
     - after_execute: called right after the call to `execute()` with the returned value
       of `execute()`. By default, do nothing.

    By default, this runner calls the interpreter's `execute_once` method only once per cycle
    (meaning at least one macro step is processed during each cycle). If `execute_all` is
    set to True, then `execute_once` is repeatedly called until no macro step can be
    processed in the current cycle.

    :param interpreter: interpreter instance to run.
    :param interval: interval between two calls to `execute`
    :param execute_all: Repeatedly call interpreter's `execute_once` method at each step.
