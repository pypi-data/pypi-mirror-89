deprecations:

    The ``[patrole].enable_rbac`` option is deprecated and will be removed
    during the "S" release. This is a legacy option that was meaningful
    downstream when Patrole was a suite of tests inside Tempest itself. Now
    that Patrole exists upstream as a Tempest plugin, it is paradoxical to
    install the Patrole plugin yet have an option that allows all Patrole
    tests to be skipped. This option is at odds with current Patrole
    architecture.

    To skip RBAC tests going forward, with Patrole Tempest plugin already
    installed, use an appropriate regex.
