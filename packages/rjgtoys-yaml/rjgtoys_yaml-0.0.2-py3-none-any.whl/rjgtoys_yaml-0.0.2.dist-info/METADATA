# Yaml: Reading and writing YAML

This is a thin layer on top of ``ruamel.yaml`` that does YAML I/O with some tricks
that I find useful:

1. It dumps structures with the layout that I like;
2. It preserves order of keys in mappings when dumping them;
3. Mappings are returned as objects that allow both attribute- and item-access;
4. Multiple files can be loaded from a directory, in a single call;
5. YAML source files can reference others, and merge them automatically, using
   an ``!include`` tag.
