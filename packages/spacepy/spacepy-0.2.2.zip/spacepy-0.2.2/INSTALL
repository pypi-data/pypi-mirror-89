SpacePy Installation Instructions:
======================+===========

For detailed, platform-specific installation information,
see Doc/build/html/install.html

Option 1) to install it in the standard loction (depending on your system)

>>> python setup.py install

Option 2) to install in custom location

>>> python setup.py install --home=/n/packages/lib/python

It is also possible to select a specific compiler for installing the IRBEM-LIB library. Currently the
following flags are supported: gnu95, gnu, pg. You can invoke these by, e.g.

>>> python setup.py install --fcompiler=pg    (will use pgi compiler suite)
>>> python setup.py install --fcompiler=gnu   (will use g77)
>>> python setup.py install --fcompiler=gnu95 (default option for using gfortran)

By default, the installer will copy pre-built documentation. If it cannot find
the pre-built docs, it will attempt to build them (requires Sphinx and numpydoc,
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ and http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc). To force a
fresh build of the documentation, use the --build-docs option to either the build
or install commands.

When first imported, SpacePy  will create a .spacepy directory in your $HOME
directory. If you prefer a different location for this directory, set the
environment variable $SPACEPY to a location of your choice. For example, with
a csh, or tcsh you would

>>> setenv SPACEPY /a/different/dir

for the bash shell you would

>>> export SPACEPY=/a/different/dir

Make sure you add the environment variable $SPACEPY to your .cshrc, .tcshrc, or .bashrc script
