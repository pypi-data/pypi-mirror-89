        Rating games is done via [rated_games](rated_games). 1 is for liked games and -1 is the opposite. You can type whatever integer you want, but I reccomend to stick with -1, 1 values.
        
        ## Output
        The output of `main.py` script is [game_ranking.html](game_ranking.html). There is simple css file written for better visualizing.
