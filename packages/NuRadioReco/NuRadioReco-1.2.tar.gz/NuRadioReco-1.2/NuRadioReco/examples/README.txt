Examples:
----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1:
python TriggerComparison.py

Works with example data and compares the triggers of ARA and ARIANNA.
----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 2:

python SimpleReconstruction.py  example_data/1e18.0eV_1e7.ari $NRMC/simulation/detectors/depth/surface_1GHz.json

Can in principle be used with any output from NuRadioMC ($NRMC) or data in .ari format. You need to know, which detector they were generated with to obtain useful results.

Work in progress.
