    A new configuration group ``[policy_feature_enabled]`` has been added to
    Patrole which will be responsible for collecting the feature flags to be
    used for newly introduced policies or policies that were changed in a
    backwards-incompatible way.

    * create_port_fixed_ips_ip_address_policy (Neutron)
    * update_port_fixed_ips_ip_address_policy (Neutron)
    * limits_extension_used_limits_policy (Cinder)
    * volume_extension_volume_actions_attach_policy (Cinder)
    * volume_extension_volume_actions_reserve_policy (Cinder)
    * volume_extension_volume_actions_unreserve_policy (Cinder)

    These feature flags will be supported until Pike release cycle is EOL.
