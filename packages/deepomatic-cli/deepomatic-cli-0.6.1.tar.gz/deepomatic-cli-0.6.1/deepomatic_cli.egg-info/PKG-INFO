        # Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install deepomatic-cli
        ```
        
        If you need rpc support, prefer:
        ```bash
        # requires deeomatic-rpc package to be installed
        pip install deepomatic-cli[rpc]
        ```
        
        # FAQ
        
        ## `opencv-python` (-headless) installation takes forever
        
        Depending on your pip version, it might rebuild it from source. 19.3 is the minimum supported version
        - Check version with `pip -V`
        - Update with `pip install 'pip>=19.3'`
        
        ## Window output doesn't work. I get a `cv2.error`.
        
        `deepomatic-cli` ships with `opencv-python-headless` as most of the features don't need a GUI.
        This also avoids requiring libGL on the system (it is for example usually not there in docker containers).
        If you want to use the GUI features, we recommend installing `opencv-python` after installing `deepomatic-cli`:
        ```bash
        pip install deepomatic-cli
        opencv_install=$(pip3 freeze | grep opencv-python-headless | sed 's/-headless//g')
        pip uninstall opencv-python-headless
        pip install $opencv_install
        ```
