Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The aim of ``federation`` is to provide and abstract multiple social web protocols like
        ActivityPub and Diaspora in one package, over an easy to use and understand Python API.
        This way applications can be built to (almost) transparently support many protocols
        without the app builder having to know everything about those protocols.

        Status
        ------
        
        Currently two protocols are being focused on. Diaspora is considered to be stable with most
        of the protocol implemented. ActivityPub support should be considered as alpha - all the basic
        things work but there are likely to be a lot of compatibility issues with other ActivityPub
        implementations.
        
        The code base is well tested and in use in several projects. Backward incompatible changes
        will be clearly documented in changelog entries.
