# zipexec is a pure python alternative to zipgrep

zipexec allows you to specify any command line utiliity you would like to run against a group of ```.zip``` files.  While zcat, zgrep and other utilities work well on gzip compressed files, I needed similar functionality on pkzip compressed files (with .zip extensions) and was unable to find a tool I liked. 

Execute command line utilities of your choice against the contents of zip files.

## Help
```
$ zipexec -h
usage: zipexec [-h] [-c CMD_TO_RUN] path_to_zips

positional arguments:
  path_to_zips          Where are the zips to search

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CMD_TO_RUN, --cmd_to_run CMD_TO_RUN
                        Command line to run on each zip
```
NOTE: Take care when specifying the names of files and commands that your local linux system does not expand the asterisks.


## Example Usage

### If you only pass a path to a folder containing zip files to zip exec it will prompt you for a command

```
$ zipexec /home/uploads/zipfiles/
What command would you like to run?: grep -R -C2 -n "search string" *

```

### If you do specify a command with -c or --command it will execute that

Example 1: grep through the content of all the zip files:

```
$ zipexec -c 'grep -R -n -C2 "import os" *.py' /home/uploads/zipfiles/  

```

Example 2: Do a directory listing of all of the zip files that are named file*.zip

```
$ zipexec -c 'ls -laR' /home/uploads/zipfiles/files\*.zip   

```
