def E_rotation(axes='e'):
    """
    Returns rotation matrix R_Ee defining the axes of the coordinate frame E.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axes : 'e' or 'E'
        defines orientation of the axes of the coordinate frame E.
        If axes is 'e' then z-axis points to the North Pole along the Earth's
        rotation axis, x-axis points towards the point where latitude = longitude = 0.
        If axes is 'E' then x-axis points to the North Pole along the Earth's
        rotation axis, y-axis points towards longitude +90deg (east) and latitude = 0.

    Returns
    -------
    R_Ee : 3 x 3 array
        rotation matrix defining the axes of the coordinate frame E as
        described in Table 2 in Gade (2010).

    Notes
    -----
    R_Ee controls the axes of the coordinate frame E (Earth-Centred,
    Earth-Fixed, ECEF) used by the other functions in this library.
    It is very common in many fields to choose axes equal to 'e'.
    If you choose axes equal to 'E' the yz-plane coincides with the equatorial
    plane. This choice of axis ensures that at zero latitude and longitude,
    frame N (North-East-Down) has the same orientation as frame E. If
    roll/pitch/yaw are zero, also frame B (forward-starboard-down) has this
    orientation. In this manner, the axes of frame E is chosen to correspond
    with the axes of frame N and B.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import nvector as nv
    >>> np.allclose(nv.E_rotation(axes='e'), [[ 0,  0,  1],
    ...                                       [ 0,  1,  0],
    ...                                       [-1,  0,  0]])
    True
    >>> np.allclose(nv.E_rotation(axes='E'), [[ 1.,  0.,  0.],

    Returns the angles about new axes in the xyz-order from a rotation matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    R_AB: 3 x 3 x n array
        rotation matrix [no unit] (direction cosine matrix) such that the
        relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is given by:
        v_A = mdot(R_AB, v_B)

    -------
    x, y, z: real scalars or array of length n.
        Angles [rad] of rotation about new axes.

    Notes
    -----
    The x, y, z angles are called Euler angles or Tait-Bryan angles and are
    defined by the following procedure of successive rotations:
    Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B. Consider a temporary frame
    T that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we
    first rotate T an angle x about its x-axis (common axis for both A and T).
    Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T. Finally, T
    is rotated an angle z about its NEWEST z-axis. The final orientation of
    T now coincides with the orientation of B.

    The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the
    right hand rule.
