# README #

Hgflow is an extension of the [Mercurial distributed version control system](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) to provide users a set of high level commands for creating, merging, and deleting branches, which includes the support for the [Driessen's branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). We also generalized the original Driessen's model by allowing user to use any branch as the base to start a (sub-)feature branch (and more).

## Get started ##

#### Download ####

* The hgflow extension contains a single Python file: `hgflow.py`.
* The latest release is [`v0.9.8.6`](https://hg.sr.ht/~wu/hgflow/tags).

* Developers can clone the repository with `hg clone ssh://hg@hg.sr.ht/~wu/hgflow`.

#### Install and configure ####

1. Untar the downloaded tar ball, and move the hgflow.py file to the directory where you place your Mercurial plugins.
2. Edit your `$HOME/.hgrc` file to add the following lines:

```
[extensions]
flow = path/to/hgflow.py
mq =

[flow]
autoshelve = yes
```

#### Help and tutorials ####

1. Use `hg flow -h` to see a synopsis of the help message.
2. Use `hg flow help @<topic>` to see detailed help message on a particular topic, e.g., `hg flow help @help`, `hg flow help @start`.
