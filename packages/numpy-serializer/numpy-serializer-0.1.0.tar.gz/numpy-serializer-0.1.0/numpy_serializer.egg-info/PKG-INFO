Description: # numpy-serializer
        
        ## Motivation
        
        I couldn't find a nice high-level package that is fast enough to serialize and deserialize numpy arrays while preserving the type
        and shape informations.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install numpy-serializer
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        
        TBD
