Description: # Ivy Used CMS Scanner
        
        ## About
        Large AxonIvy projects usually have huge number amount of CMSs, and overtime, after countless times
        of adding, updating and removing the CMSs, there will be `zoombie` CMSs in your code base.
        
        The idea of this tool is pretty simple:
        
        >In each project:
        >  - List out all *.data and co.meta files
        >  - Group the *.data files with their corresponding co.meta file
        >  - Search the CMS in [*.java, *.drl, *.xhtml, *.mod] files using >  - CMS's path (example: /fintech/soba/authentication/message/accessdenied)
        >  - If no result found -> CMS is not being used
