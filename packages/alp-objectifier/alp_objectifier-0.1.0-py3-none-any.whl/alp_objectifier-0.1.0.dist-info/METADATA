# ALP Objectifier

As AnyLogic has hundreds of built-in example models that cover a wide range of industries and use-cases, it is extremely time consuming to find a model that fulfills more conditions than can be searched for by descriptions alone. For example, looking for a model that uses System Dynamics inside of a non-Main agent, or one that contains more than three layers of nested agents.

This library is able to parse AnyLogic source files (.alp) and turn it into a parsable, read-only Python object.
