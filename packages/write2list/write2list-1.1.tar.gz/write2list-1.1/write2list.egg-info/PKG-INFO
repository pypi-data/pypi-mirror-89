Description: # write2list
        
        A simple python package which accepts a Tuple of Lists and converts it to a List. I wrote this to learn how custom packages work in Python. Here is the quick difference between a Tuple and a List-
        
        | Tuple              | List                          |
        |:------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
        | Immutable bindings | Mutable via Append and Extend |
        
        ### How to use?
        
        ```bash
        pip install write2list
        ```
        
        ```Python
        # test.py
        import write2list
        
        exampleTuple=(["Hi I am the first example list"], ["123456"], ["Wow these are one too many lists for a simple example. Let's end this object here."])
        
        resultList=write2list.create(exampleTuple)
        
        print(resultList)
        ```
        
        ```bash
        python test.py
        ['Hi I am the first example list', '123456', "Wow these are one too many lists for a simple example. Let's end this object here."]
        ```
